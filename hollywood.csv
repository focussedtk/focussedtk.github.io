03/19/2023,Zendaya CALLED OUT For Forcing Her Stylist to QUIT?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnw7PUkbhj0,118-12,who would have thought that Zendaya would get called out one day for allegedly making her stylist retire from his career yes I'm talking about law roach who concerned millions of people and celebs earlier this week after he announced his retirement for mysterious reasons you know Hollywood is a really dark place but it's certainly nothing when it comes to the fashion industry because we all know the rumors that go around there such as models being overworked and underpaid and even some of them including stylists being taken advantage of however the news of law roach quitting this week made a lot of people come to their senses about the fashion industry and instead of them figuring out the reasons behind his decision they decided to attack Zendaya for being behind all of it so let's get right to it for those of you who don't know La Roach is a 44 year old Fashion Stylist who went viral over the years for working with many celebrities and his popularity doesn't just come from hanging out with mega celebs this man is the literal definition of art itself from styling various people with groundbreaking outfits to styling popular celebs with dresses for important ceremonies this man gained a lot of attention on social media to the point where many celebrities decided to hire him as their stylist I mean you can literally go on Google right now and type out law roach's work and you'll find that your favorite celebs outfits were styled by him that's how important of a person in Hollywood he actually is you guys have probably seen him working with Ariana Grande for this iconic dress at the Grammys and of course we can't forget about those outfits that he put on a Taylor joy in for multiple award shows and if you thought this was it well Bella Hadid has also worked with law roach for these cute dresses and y'all even Celine Dion herself was styled by La Roach for years and years I could literally go on and on and on about the outfits that La Roche has put these celebs in that we weren't aware of this just shows that stylists barely get the recognition for their work anymore because just recently you guys multiple celebs attending the Oscars after party such as Megan the stallion Hunter Schaefer and more and guess what law roach turned out to be the one who styled most of them I know insane despite how crazy this week has been for law roach regarding him styling these celebs no one really expected him to announce his retirement the day after the Oscars happened since not only did he make an Instagram post thanking his fans for supporting him over the years but he also shared a cryptic message at the end of his retirement announcement that made a lot of people confused my cup is empty thank you to everyone who've supported me and my career over the years every person that trusted me with their image I am so grateful for all of you if this business was just about the clothes I would do it for the rest of my life but unfortunately it's not the politics the lies and false narratives finally got me you win in I'm out of course this announcement you guys shocked millions of people on social media I mean everyone in the comments was confused as to what made law quit all of a sudden after working in the industry for almost 14 years and you guys even celebrities and influencers went on his comment section to express their disappointment Over Law quitting his career Naomi Campbell wrote in a comment law I won't let you we don't quit strived too hard Addison Ray Bella Thorne and even Lauren jagueri expressed their feelings by saying what we are gonna miss you don't give up them you're a baddie and don't let them dim your light you're too shiny yeah a lot of celebs and influencers were surprised that law was officially quitting his career in fact many tick-tockers even went on social media to discuss the topic and the conspiracies behind Law's decision and of course that's when law started making headlines everywhere from people making up conspiracy theories to law trending on social media for days his announcement became a huge topic of discussion among many users online and unfortunately that's when things took a wild turn after many people came up with the conclusion that Zendaya was behind law quitting his career yeah guys in case you didn't know Zendaya and law have been working together for years in fact they're known for being pretty close in the industry after law went viral because of how much Zendaya praised his work in tons of interviews and awards shows thankfully when I was 14 I found my my co-director of sorts one who saw what I did and sometimes more than I could have ever imagined on my own that being a law Roach [Applause] my fashion soul mate historian and constant inspiration thank you for pushing me to see all of myself and teaching me how to do so fearlessly both law and Zendaya seemed to admire each other's work a lot in fact Zendaya recently went to the Oscars with an outfit that La Roche himself styled well everything seems completely normal between them right unfortunately it turned out to be quite the opposite you guys after a Twitter user shared a video from a week ago of law roach being pissed at the Louis Vuitton show for not having a front row seat next to Zendaya [Music] it makes sense why law roach would be pissed at Louis Vuitton for not giving him a front seat because he was invited by them either way to attend the show plus he also styled Zendaya for this special event and most stylists sit in the front seat but laws specifically he has always sat in the front seat at many fashion show events and for him to be left with no place to sit makes you wonder what could have gone wrong now in the video Zendaya seemed to be telling law to sit behind her since Emma Stone had already taken the place that he was supposed to sit in and for that it made some people attack Emma Stone first on social media and blame her for being behind Law's retirement Emma Stone should have just gotten up damn if we're talking fashion power yes she should have for real like move you're not even serving like that I don't like how she was mindlessly staring at him after Emma Stone became the target of so many people in this situation some fans began speculating whether Zendaya was also behind this entire drama or not and the reason for that is because of how she seemed unbothered in the video with law roach sitting behind her instead of next to her to make this even worse you guys some people also noticed that law roach didn't sit behind Zendaya in another video which raised the speculations even more that Zendaya could have been the reason behind law quitting just take a look at what people had to say not gonna lie this made me look at Zendaya differently if you've ever had a friend douche like this to you you know how embarrassing and hurtful it can be spending hours on her outfit to get hit with a there's some seats in the back I just know he was planning his Farewell right there l-o-l he helped her not the other way around she always treated him like a bodyguard and Trail person no gratitude whatsoever Have You Seen Her Style before him pathetic it was yeah many people were blaming Zendaya in this case as she started trending on Twitter immediately with tons of users making false claims about hers such as law being treated horribly by her and much more however Zendaya's fans were able to shut down those rumors ASAP after they began sharing videos and posts of Zendaya praising Law's work and giving him credit on stage Zendaya has always spoken highly about law roach she has always cherished the work and achievements they've accomplished together blaming her for his retirement is so disrespectful to make law roach's retirement about Zendaya is extremely weird she has nothing to do with it the fashion industry has not always treated black stylists and creatives with the respect they deserve after many fans tried defending Zendaya for being innocent in this entire mess law decided to go on Twitter the next day to clear up the rumors about him weaving Zendaya by saying that she will always be his sister and that there will never be bad blood between them so y'all really think I'm breaking up with Z We Are Forever she's my little sister and it's real love not the fake industry love literally me and Zendaya I'm glad that law cleared this up to be honest because at one point it was going way way too far especially with people making speculations about their friendship however some people do believe that Zendaya was low-key behind Law's retirement since she recently signed a contract with Louis Vuitton and we all know that Louis Vuitton has some type of bitterness towards him which explains why he left with no C at their recent show either way Law's retirement is still a mystery for so many people to this day but I do want to bring up this clip of law from his recent interview where he talked about how he could easily walk away from his career if the fashion industry tried to disrespect his work you can't talk to me anymore can't treat me any kind of way you know you I'm coming in and I'm I'm committed a certain amount of respect you if you if you've not giving me that we're gonna have a problem like I'm not really afraid of this this industry because I'm black I'm from Hood I can always go back like I'll always make money I'll always get money I'll always be successful and if I have to get into a situation where I have to re-work who I am or what I'm doing there I'm not afraid of that right I would love to hear your opinions on this situation down below but for now make sure to click on the tab above for more juicy videos on these influencers [Music] 
03/16/2023,The Oscars 2023 were a HOT MESS!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4QSckdNBEo,120-17,you guys the 95th annual Oscars just took place earlier this week and let's just say it was a hot mess are we even surprised before anyone says anything no I am not talking about your favorite actor receiving an Oscar this year I'm talking about the embarrassing moments that went down not only on the red carpet but also during the ceremony and the after party there's a lot to unpack in today's video you guys so without further Ado Let's Just Jump Right In you guys don't understand the anticipation for this year's Oscars I mean people have been sharing conversations on social media about this ceremony for months now and y'all even some hardcore fans have been predicting the winners for this year's Oscars as they're hoping that their favorite movie was so weep all the awards of course we know the big mess that went down at the Oscars last year between Will Smith and Chris Rock and how they both had an altercation on stage that ended up costing Will's career as he got banned from attending the Oscars in the future although this in entire drama you guys brought tons of viewers for this year's Oscars in fact the viewership increased by 12 this year drawing almost 18.7 million viewers yeah Will Smith definitely deserves credit for that not gonna lie because trust me people are gonna tune into the Oscars each year in hopes of getting another drama between other actors now let's talk about the red carpet situation that happened at the Oscars because as you all know a lot of celebs attended this year due to tons of movie nominations and while we also witnessed some influencers and tick-tockers attending the red carpet along the way but that's a different story we saw Andrew Garfield Zendaya Rihanna Haley Bailey Florence Pugh and so many of your fave celebs and y'all we even got blessed to see tick tockers on the red carpet as well such as cabbie lame Drew aflallo Lilly sin and Emma Chamberlain yeah I still don't understand the point of these tick-tockers and YouTubers getting invited to important events however that's not the case here because the one and only Lady Gaga showed up at the Oscars this year and let's just say it was catastrophic I mean she did show up looking absolutely stunning as always but unfortunately it didn't end up going quite well for her on the red carpet after she tried to help a photographer who fell and then this happened [Music] thank you very very nice of you at first you might think that Lady Gaga was sweet enough to help the photographer after he fell but then there's another angle of the incident that went viral and well a lot of people noticed that Lady Gaga looked pissed as hell after the photographer touched her waist intentionally while standing up check this out [Music] oh social media is still speculating whether Lady Gaga felt uncomfortable with the photographer touching her or whether it was just a big misunderstanding but based on people's reactions a lot of them are pointing out that the Pat was very inappropriate especially when Lady Gaga is known for being an essay Survivor now this wasn't the only incident that went down at this year's Oscars because there's an interview on the red carpet going around that the actor Hugh Grant was being rude to the interviewer Ashley Graham and well just take a look at how Hugh handled the questions Ashley was asking him what's your favorite thing about coming to the Oscars um well uh it's fascinating it's a it's of the whole of humanity is here it's uh it's Vanity Fair okay well what are you wearing tonight then just my suit your suit who made yours you didn't make it um I can't remember my tailor tell me what does it feel like to be in Glass Onion it was such an amazing film I really love did I love a thriller how fun is it to shoot something like that well I'm barely in it I'm in it for about three seconds yeah but still showed up and you had fun right uh almost okay all right okay I don't understand why he agreed to be interviewed in the first place if he wanted to be rude to the interviewer but I guess tons of people are canceling him over this video for being rude and immature as he is currently trending on Twitter speaking of Twitter let's talk about the mess that Twitter users started at the Oscars because as you all know many people have been praying that Angela Bassett aka the woman who starred in the movie Black Panther wins an Oscar for best supporting actress but unfortunately she lost it somehow to the actress Jamie Lee who starred in the movie everything everywhere all at once and well just take a look at how Angela Bassett reacted to losing the Oscar to Jamie Jamie Lee people also shared their responses to Jaime winning the award over Angela by saying this ain't no way Angela Bassett didn't win my heart hurts so bad for Angela Bassett like I know she wanted this so bad for Chadwick Angela Bassett not winning best supporting actress is just aside from fans sharing their disappointment over Angela losing her Oscar nomination they've also been bullying both Lady Gaga and Rihanna on social media and the reason for this is that both of them performed their soundtrack songs on stage at the Oscars this year and a lot of people pointed out how Rihanna sounded horrible while she was singing live it's the fact that y'all are bullying her over this performance when she literally performed at the Oscars and Super Bowl while being pregnant could anyone pull this off like her I mean the same thing goes for Lady Gaga as well people have been going after her on Twitter for multiple reasons after she raised major concern at the Oscars for delivering a raw and emotional performance on stage for some reason many people found Lady Gaga's performance in concerning as not only did they accuse her of being off-key but for allegedly being on pills yeah this is a huge accusation to make on someone who just wanted to take off her makeup and deliver a raw performance for her fans but I guess the internet keeps being dramatic anyways on to some good news we actually witnessed history at the Oscars this year I know surprising but as I mentioned before Michelle yo who played a big role in the movie everything everywhere all at once won an Oscar for her role best actress and y'all she became the second woman of color along with Halle Berry to win the award in 95 years anyways here's a video of Halle Berry tearfully presenting Michelle her Best Actress Oscar this Oscar must have been very important for Michelle because even her mom reacted to her daughter winning the award on live television and y'all her reaction was priceless check this out so there was an after party that happened after the Oscars ceremony ended and it was hosted by none other than Beyonce and while many celebs including Shawn Mendes the Jenners Billy eilish and even Megan the stallion decided to show up at the after party to celebrate with their friends people were surprised to see Haley Having the courage to go public following her recent drama with Selena Gomez however a lot of people pointed out that Justin was nowhere to be found at the after party carpet with Haley as he was seen partying already inside the venue and while many people found this move very shady from Justin considering the fact that his wife has been receiving hate from millions of people just for you to let your wife go on the red carpet alone here is what some people had to say I'd be so embarrassed if I were her after he didn't defend her the least he could do is walk with her to show minimum support lowest effort husband I'd be embarrassed ASF if my husband dressed like that at a formal event he loves embarrassing hail really wifey doing the most for stay relevant anyways loves make sure to click on the tab above for more juicy videos on these celebs

03/15/2023,Zendaya Gets Called Out (law roach retires),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUoaLQenDmw,119-11,Beast story is a weird one because of how random and unexpected it is now I love Zendaya so let me start off right away by saying that but people think that she has something to do with her stylist announcing his retirement no I don't think she's exactly the reason I think the reasoning is about the fashion industry but we're gonna get into what people are saying and why she's trending alongside this retirement news La Roche is Iconic for styling Zendaya and yesterday he posted on Instagram saying he was retiring and the News came at a complete shock to so many people especially with the mechologist around the corner and him just having styled a bunch of people for red carpet and getting a ton of Praise those who know and love him were literally so sad over this news I mean it was a viral story that's for sure everyone was talking about it yesterday people just could not believe what was going on they wanted to know why they wanted to know if this was real they just couldn't believe it there is definitely some drama going behind this because legendary celebrity stylist La Roche just announced his retirement out of nowhere no way after styling quite literally everyone at Vanity Fair law roach is retiring I am shocked this is really sad I hope that it's a break for my own selfish reasons wow say psych says like right now what is this what what is what is going on what is oh my God I'm why am I like about I'm genuinely like tearing up I'm about to start crying imagine the shock on my face at the law roach has been killing these red carpets to see that he's announcing his retirement today so La Roche is a pretty famous celebrity stylist if you guys do not know he's credited for a number of Zendaya's viral red carpet looks and hundreds of other celebrity Styles as well here's just a few iconic moments of his throughout the years and I'm sure you guys will recognize some of them we've got Zendaya's Cinderella transformation at the 2019 Met Gala Ariana Grande's 2020 Grammys dress he even styled Ari for the thank you next music video I mean this is just a small tiny sample of the looks that he's curated over the years and he was getting complimented a ton after the Vanity Fair Oscar party this week where a ton of celebrities were dressed by him his clients included Eve jobs literally Steve Jobs daughter Haley Steinfeld Carrie Washington Hunter Schaefer which we got a censor because it's a little risky for YouTube but loved this look and mega stallion so him saying that he was retiring after all of the Vanity Fair praise he just got was definitely throwing people off people were so confused he captioned his Instagram post saying my cup is empty thank you to everyone who supported me and my career over the years every person that trusted me with their image I'm so grateful for you all if this business was just about to close I would do it for the rest of my life but unfortunately it's not the politics the lies and false narratives finally got me you win I'm out celebrities were in shock by this news although some were you know supportive they were saying that if he needs this time for his mental health they were here for him but people were shook me easy Nash said we all come our go on our own terms if you're done because you want your next roll blessings to you if you're having a moment keep your main character energy either way you got this Addison Ray Roman said what NeNe Leakes said mental health is first Naomi said law I won't let you we don't quit strive too hard there was tons of speculation going around as to what could have made him possibly have wanted to retire and Zendaya's name got thrown out there because of a recent video that the two of them were in the video made its rounds on Twitter on March 6th the day of the Louis Vuitton fashion show in Paris and it was getting brought back up because people remembered how awkward the video was of this interaction between law and Zendaya when they arrived at the show and like I said I'm not 100 sure as to if this is why or this is what triggered him wanting to retire this is just what the internet is feeling and this is how Zendaya kind of got brought up into this whole thing so I'm just gonna play you guys the video and then we'll kind of go through it so basically we just saw Zendaya come inside to sit down for the show she was seated in the front row with Emma Stone and Pharrell Williams who are the Louis Vuitton brand ambassadors which led a lot of people to believe that she was being added to the list of their next ambassadors to come but the thing is when she arrived to that front row she was with La Roche and there just seemed to only be one C left so she kind of looked behind her in motion that there was a spot in the second row where he could sit and it seems like he just leaves after that because he never sits behind her at any point there's been a lot of opinions going around about this video with some saying why would a stylist sit in the front row others pointed out that he sat front row a number of times for different shows and he's a celebrity in his own right not just a stylist some people felt like it was rude of Zendaya that she should have gotten up other people were like that's crazy like why would she get up she is Zendaya she's an Ayla celebrity she should be front row she earned that seat she shouldn't have to give up a seat and then there's people that are looking at Louis Vuitton sideways for not having a seat front row for him it definitely was just like uncomfortable like the vibe seemed off But whichever way people were looking at this video Zendaya's name was getting brought up somehow someway and that's just simply because these two have worked together since Zendaya was a teenager they've become an iconic duo in fashion she specifically has sat front row with him a number of times on a number of events and so some were feeling like him not having his seat this time hurt his feelings and maybe there was something about the LV show that set him over the edge about the industry as a whole and that kind of led to his retirement I think there's definitely more to the story here that we just do not know about that goes Way Beyond this one video of Zendaya and him and what he's talking about in his Instagram post about the industry I think that maybe just maybe what happened at the Louis Vuitton show might have triggered him wanting to retire but I don't think it's a sole reason what I see from this video is that she was rushing to get a receipt there was room for him he didn't really seem happy with the situation and there must have been something going on that day or they arrived late or something because Zendaya was talking to Emma Stone after he walked away and it kind of seemed like an intense situation so maybe they were rushing to get there maybe that's why he didn't have a seat I don't think that sent him into retirement alone but I do think if he was already feeling some sort of way about the industry and then he got there and felt like wow they really didn't give me a seat here I worked so hard I had these crazy big clients I've made these iconic looks I'm not getting the respect that I deserve and that was maybe the reason why he wanted to retire because I don't think it was Zendaya I don't think that she's the sole reason why otherwise he would just like not work with her anymore you know but to retire that's that's like I don't want to work with anyone you gotta say that there's actually an interview of law talking about the fashion industry and that he doesn't really stand for any BS and he would walk away if he disrespected um I'm very opinionated right and um I'm also you can't talk to me any kind of way and you can't treat me any kind of way you know you I'm coming in and I'm I'm committed a certain amount of respect you if you if you've not giving me that we're gonna have a problem like I'm not really afraid of this this industry because I'm black I'm from the hood I can always go back like I'll always make money I'll always get money I'll always be successful and if I have to get into a situation where I have to re-work who I am or what I'm doing that I'm not afraid of that right so I'm ready to go toe-to-toe with a publicist or AJ or a manager because I don't feel like I need you because you didn't you've never done me anyway I'm self-made you know what I mean like I built my career I didn't go to Conventional routes to everybody go and you know this person you oh this person a favor I owe nobody in this industry and so I'm like I'll walk away from all that because I'm just I'm a natural born Hustler and like I said earlier that megala is around the corner and I wonder if he has clients that are working with him and he's just like I'm done I quit I'm over fashioned I'm done with the industry and now they're just kind of screwed like could you imagine that if that seriously something that's happening they have got to be freaking out because that first man Monday in May is coming up but who knows what the real story is behind the sudden retirement or this is even a real retirement at all he could come back he can totally change his mind he could even still be styling just certain clients now maybe he's like retiring working with new clients I don't know you guys but I guess we will just have to see all these celebrities shocked by the news and the people talking online certainly has shown those who didn't put in front row that his name does have weight and people do have eyes on him and maybe that was the message that he was trying to send by doing all of this but that's what's been going on in the fashion bubble I certainly want to know what you guys think about all of this do you think now that a lot of people are like fighting for him to have been in the front row people are talking about how iconic his looks have been that he's trending he might reconsider because of the online response let me know in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys
03/12/2023,Jenna Ortega CANCELED For Defending Percy Hynes White?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn-3j_01Khg,121-18,it was only a matter of time before Jenna Ortega would get canceled by the entire internet since not only did she receive hate for recently just being herself but she also got called out by many of her fans for supporting Percy Hines white following his recent controversy this is going to be a wild ride honestly you guys we should have seen Jenna Ortega's cancellation coming at one point because the amount of love and support she's received over the year has been insane and the fact that she's getting attacked all of a sudden explains how the internet treats these celebs nowadays by switching on them in the place of an eye let's just go ahead and take a look at what started this entire mess ever since the Netflix show Wednesday came out people have been freaking out about Jenna Ortega's character more than the rest of the cast in the show and the reason for that is because a lot of people found Jenna very interesting as an actress and she has that it factor that could potentially change her career if she keeps going this situation made Jenna gain success immediately after the show was released in fact the the show hasn't left the top 10 on Netflix since its release date in November 2022. I know crazy now when these celebs gain popularity and attention in a span of days on social media they become more exposed to receiving hate and bullying comments on the internet and unfortunately Jenna was the target of this not only did she attract millions of young teens to follow her and support her but she even made grown men and sports fans become obsessed with her to the point where they started flooding her entire comment sections with flirting and special jokes of course Jenna handled the situation perfectly by staying off the internet the majority of the time although she did become active recently on social media to promote her new movie Scream 6 which is coming out soon and well let's just say that this was the beginning of the end for Jenna from her doing multiple interviews per day to her going on talk shows to promote her new movie Scream 6. it really put Jenna out for the public to watch and share their opinions on whatever she was going on and while this got her into a bit of a mess on social media after she got dragged for collabing with Demi Lovato in a tick tock video to promote her movie Scream Six hello Jenna get a job stay away from her yeah not sure why people were so pressed about Jenna and Demi promoting the movie together but I guess the internet had some sort of hatred towards Demi for multiple reasons and seeing them with Jenna disappointed many fans out there anyways speaking of disappointment there are conversations happening on social media right now that Jenna Ortega is being overworked and no I'm not only talking about her promoting her new movie Scream 6 every day because just recently she was announced as a lead actor in the new movie that will begin filming soon and this movie you guys will be co-directed by the one and only the weekend yeah as crazy as this announcement may sound from the looks of it it seems that it will be happening 100 after Jenna recently went on an interview to praise the weekend for being genuine and a sweetheart but what's been your favorite thing about working with him so far um well what I can't say about able is he's genuinely such a sweetheart uh I instantly comfortable instantly um he's just he's very respectful and and very um yeah I don't know very collaborative I guess you can say which when you're working on a set especially with um the the team on that project is is really really wonderful and um I I think that you know sometimes you don't really know how much you could say but they've all been immense collaborative and wanting to know my voice and my opinion and that's always a really wonderful feeling when you're stepping onto a set for the first show if you thought this was it while it has only gotten worse you guys because earlier this week a news article about Jenna went viral on social media that she's been considering signing a deal with Marvel Studios for a while now and well we all know that Marvel Studios pays good money for these actors especially if they give her a major role in a superhero movie other than this Jenna was also announced as a lead actress in a new movie that will be dropping next year and that movie includes the Riverdale star Camila Mendes and other popular actors just imagine how crazy this all is for her I mean at the end of the day she was the one who put herself up with these challenges and chose to sign deals for these upcoming movies but let's not forget that Wednesday season 2 will most likely start filming at the end of this year as well and now it's leaving me with questions about whether these decisions were made by Jenna herself or not I mean we're all aware that Jenna hasn't been in this amount of movies and shows in a single year and as far as we know she opened up a couple of weeks ago about how shooting for Wednesday made her hysterically cry over its rigorous schedule despite how Jenna received tons of backlash for her whining about her job she recently went on the armchair expert podcast to talk about her life career and friends and while she mentioned how everything about her character Wednesday made no sense at all and that she almost became unprofessional at her job by changing the lines in the script for being way too corny check this out I don't think I've ever had to put my foot down on a set in a way that I had to on Wednesday because it's so easy to fall into that category especially with this type of show everything that she does everything that I had to play did not make sense for her character at all her being in a love triangle made no sense there was a line about like a stress that she has to wear for a school dance and she said oh my God I love it I can't believe I said that I literally hate myself and I had to go no Jenna also revealed during the podcast that she expected her show Wednesday to be way darker when she initially signed on and that she was kind of surprised that the target audience was young people when I first went on of the show I didn't have all the scripts and I thought that it was going to be a lot darker I thought it was going to be more of that broken neck stuff but then it wasn't so I thought oh okay I see where we're going but then it still had the opposite effect which is really funny to me I didn't know what the tone was yeah I didn't know but the score was gonna sound like the way it was gonna be cut together or when we're doing more dramatic scenes it's okay well let's not get too melodramatic wow it's funny how a day after she dragged the entire production team for Wednesday she got announced as executive producer for Wednesday season two but I guess it's about time for her to take control and carry the show herself now instead of the internet celebrating this huge announcement about Jenna being an executive producer they actually decided to cancel her for good and this came after Jenna got too carried away with the conversation during the podcast and revealed that she's very close with her Wednesday co-star Percy Heinz white cast member did you end up becoming bestest friends with there's a couple of them Percy and Georgie so they would like wait for me after I rap shooting to like go for walks or they would like cook me dinner or they would clean Apartments literally we mothered each other yeah a lot of people didn't know how to feel about this because if you guys have seen my previous videos then you'll know about Percy Hines White's recent controversies and how he got exposed by multiple victims for essaying them years ago other than this he was also exposed for threatening his old friends sending unsolicited pictures to mine owners and even making Fist and fat phobic jokes so the fact that Jenna went on a podcast to talk about her love for Percy knowing that people have been trying to cancel him for over two months is a bit questionable not gonna lie and just in case you guys thought that Jenna somehow might have been unaware of the allegations against Percy while her production team recently considered firing Percy after his allegations came out however they decided to hold on to that decision and keep him for season two anyways

02/22/2023,Joshua Bassett is being CONTROLLED by the CHURCH?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myKJvMSb5mc,100-18,guys Joshua Bassett is concerning millions of fans on the internet for not only getting baptized at an anti-lgbtq plus church but for also getting brainwashed by conversion therapy this is going to be an intense one as we all know Joshua Bassett went through a lot back in 2021 with his relationships and career and as a result of that his career ended up boosting after he got targeted by millions of people worldwide but the question is how did the hate train towards him all start well this goes way back to 2020 when Joshua's ex-girlfriend Olivia Rodrigo decided to drop a song called driver's license where she talked about being betrayed by Joshua and his new girlfriend Sabrina Carpenter after this song gained major success on social media millions of people decided to tune into the drama and throw hay at both Sabrina and Joshua after they received tons of hate comments and death threats and started trending for days on Twitter unfortunately this situa Asian ended up getting very serious later on after Joshua got hospitalized for suffering from septic shock and heart failure and well this came two days after the song dropped when millions of people bullied him constantly for allegedly cheating on Olivia even though this was very heartbreaking unfortunately the fans felt no sympathy for Joshua at all after they started making memes on Twitter about him being hospitalized that received thousand thousands of likes and the worst part about it you guys is that the drama kept on going for two years with Olivia dropping song after song to which she dropped an entire album months later a year after this went down both Sabrina and Joshua decided to keep their relationship away from the internet just to avoid the hate in which they called it quits at the end of 2021 throughout 2022 Everything went perfect between Olivia and Joshua after they reunited at the premiere of high school musicals and took pictures together on the red carpet and y'all even Olivia and Sabrina met at the Met Gala and were seen having conversations together as well it was just surprising for fans to see how the love triangle chose peace with all the drama that was going around on social media but Joshua had his own situation going on with him and his haters online after he got bullied for coming out as a member of the lgbtq plus Community yeah guys it all went down after Joshua went on an interview to talk about his love for the singer Harry Styles and while he's somehow hinted at his sexual body during the interview after he caught himself revealing too much information about his feelings towards Harry Styles check this out kind of does it all like acting singing Fashion and I think that he's just a nice guy who doesn't say too much but when he talks like it matters does every sense he's just cool like he's cool who doesn't think hairstyles is cool also he's hot you know he's very Charming too lots of things I guess this is my um is this also my coming out video after Joshua made this comment he then went to GQ to interview and revealed that he's part of the lgbtq plus Community but he's anti-coming out and yeah he even posted a very emotional letter about toxic masculinity on his Instagram and how he was raised with the Boys Don't Cry mentality as much as Joshua was trying to be vulnerable people found a way to throw hate at him again after they started questioning whether he had feelings for Olivia and Sabrina this entire time or not you just know Sabrina and that girl with her driving license are punching the air right now the girls did all that fighting for nothing goodbye Joshua Bassett really got Olivia and Sabrina metaphoring him to death and he wants Harry Styles I guess he didn't mean what he wrote in that song about her anyways a year after this mess went down Olivia Sabrina and Joshua's attention slowly began to fade after each of them went separate ways to focus on themselves and their career however one specific person that ended up sparking major concern this week was Joshua Bassett after he revealed that he recently got baptized and an anti-lgbtq plus Church you get baptized my name is Joshua and long story short I I grew up Christian and I ran the other way as far as I could go in Pursuit Of Truth and that only ended in uh addiction depression uh suicidal ideation Eating Disorders Etc and no other teacher gave me anywhere near the peace that Jesus Christ did yeah guys this all started at the end of 2022 when Joshua made a tweet saying how he was struggling and how he's willing to seek help and be good to himself most people I know including myself are struggling right now please be good to yourselves and others reach out to support those you love and don't be afraid to ask for help a couple of days later Joshua started opening up about finding Jesus and his faith on social media and he began sharing religious messages on his Twitter that ended up concerning many of his fans Jesus Christ is the only way his death and Resurrection are historically documented turn away from hate seek forgiveness and come to him the gospel is good news for all willing to love and Obey him who keeps Your Heart Beating For some reason many fans found it weird and creepy how Joshua's mindset and personality completely changed based on those tweets especially after he posted multiple Instagram stories seeking forgiveness from God as much as people were concerned about him Joshua did eventually respond to people's comments by saying that he's better than he's ever been and that he has encountered Jesus twice in his real life a month after Joshua made these comments he decided to post a video on Twitter this week sharing that he recently got baptized at a church called Bethel church and while things went downhill from there if you guys don't know Bethel Church well it's a well-known Church in the U.S that has a long-documented history of homophobia and transphobia and it is often known for actively advocating for conversion therapy and encouraging people to leave homosexuality behind this situation worried millions of fans worldwide after they thought that Joshua might have been brainwashed by this church through conversion therapy for being a member of the lgbtq plus Community Joshua Bassett a bi-man joining a church that actively supports conversion therapy is not good Joshua Bassett going from normal teenage Disney actor to die hard Evangelical Christian in the span of months is worrying okay finding out the church he's at does conversion therapy me I am so serious they literally brainwashed Joshua Bassett Joshua Bassett running to a mega church that supports conversion therapy to get saved in it especially when you're on a show that features mostly an lgbtq cast members and story lines what a betrayal of lgbtq friends and fans after fans shared their comments on social media Joshua took to Twitter to respond to people's questions and whether he supports them or not and y'all just take a look at his answer I visited this church and happened to get baptized there I was unaware of some of their policies and beliefs and do not endorse all of them my heart is for Christ and Christ Alone to be abundantly clear I love all if you are a human being you have a seat at my table we are called to love and let God do the rest first John 2 9 whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness Joshua did end up deleting one tweet that he made where he called out the corruption that goes on within some of the churches in the U.S and how people must hold them accountable it's sickens and added to me to see the amount of corruption within far too many churches we must hold them all accountable into the highest possible standard please do not mistake those who claim to know God for the true and perfect Creator we're still not sure whether Joshua was forced to delete this tweet or not but let's just hope that he is taking care of himself and finds peace within himself 
02/20/2023,Jenna Ortega CANCELED For Crying on Wednesday Set?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3oXNznylpk,98-18,Jenna Ortega just got dragged by the entire internet for whining about not getting any sleep while filming her Netflix show Wednesday it seems like no one has caught a break ever since the show came out anyways here's what you need to know about the Wednesday cast and how they all became seemingly cursed after getting major success in the series if you guys have seen my previous video on Jenna then you probably know all the success her Netflix show Wednesday received on social media in fact Wednesday became one of the most watched Netflix series of all time after the production company paid loads of money to create so much hype and anticipation to promote the show for months and eventually it worked in their favor yeah we know that Jenna wasn't really that big of an actress before Wednesday because she has been in the acting field for almost 10 years of her life she began acting in the series Jane the Virgin back in 2014 and two years later she starred in the Disney Channel series stuck in the middle in 2016 as well despite the field recognition she received for her roles on these TV shows Jenna managed to find another way to go viral on the internet after she became a full-on musically star and began dating Jacob Sartorius back in 2017. the attention Jenna received from Jacob's fanbase really put her out there in the Hollywood spotlight [Music] after she got asked to play a role on the popular Netflix series you and of course she accepted the offer and made the entire internet fall in love with her character Miss Jos secretly has six Chihuahuas so she walks them and shifts and you you are well betterheim L.A newly not only did she get you get millions of people after they began following her on social media and asking her to star in more movies three years later Jenna became one of the most requested young artists in the Hollywood industry after she played two main roles in the horror movies Scream 5 and X and to be honest this was the moment where Jenna became recognized by the majority of the internet after she started getting paid millions of dollars for every role she was playing and even became a meme at one point two years later the popular Netflix show Wednesday was released and Jenna was finally the main character but well everything went downhill from there of course I'm not talking about the success Jenna received on social media because the moment the show dropped Jenna went viral immediately on Tick Tock and Twitter and 10 days later she gained over 11 million followers on Instagram after she went from 9 to 20 million followers in a split second I know insane she currently has over 40 million followers since the show dropped and by that Global recognition you can only hope for good to come because not only did people try to assume Jenna's sexuality based on the role she played in Wednesday but she even got accused of admitting to be a lesbian after she allegedly waved at a fan who was holding a lesbian flag at her event people were very disappointed once they found out that Jenna was in fact waving at another fan instead of the person who was waving the lesbian flag but what made the whole situation worse you guys is when people started digging out old tweets of Jenna saying lesbian writes just to prove that she's in the closet and y'all for some reason they even accused her of doing a lesbian salute on stage at the end of her interview a couple of months after people tried to show Jenna's sexuality down her throat and force her to come out one of the Wednesday cast members Percy Hines white got canceled on social media after he allegedly has made multiple girls and minors in the past a person who went by miklovich on Twitter posted a long thread of her and other victims exposing Percy for not only fat shaming and threatening his old friends but even sending unsolicited pictures of him to minors in group chats and to make it even worse you guys some victims even spoke about how Percy let one of his friends our word a girl in his basement other than this see also got exposed for a lot of horrible stuff he has said in the past such as him saying a racist slur in a video and a tweet and of course don't forget about him being a fan of Nazi white supremacist pro-gun Instagram Pages all of this you guys made Percy trend for days on social media in fact he became inactive on Instagram for following the allegations which made him lose a couple of thousand followers for not addressing any of the situations yet now let's move on to the recent drama that has been circulating on the internet and that is the director of Wednesday being racist and irresponsible Yeah Tim Burton aka the guy who directed the entire Wednesday show is getting backlashed from millions of fans worldwide after they accused him of being racist for casting only black actors as bullies and this came after the black actress Joy Sunday played a mean girl at Nevermore Academy and black actor Iman Marson portrayed a bully and the son of a corrupt mayor the reason why people spoke about this issue was be because of Tim Burton's past films and how he has a history of casting only white actors in his movies except for his movie Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children in which the popular actor Samuel L Jackson starred in despite all this drama and accusations regarding the show Wednesday Unfortunately they did not stop coming you guys since Jenna recently got called out by millions of people because of her recent interview after she recalled how she used to hysterically cry over Wednesday filming schedules and y'all this is what she said I did not get any sleep I pulled my hair out there's so many FaceTime calls that my dad answered of me hysterically crying after Jenna made this claim you guys she got dragged by millions of people on social media for not only whining about her job but even trying to gain sympathy from the media when she earned millions of dollars from her role here's what people had to say about Jenna regarding her interview she won't be crying when that direct deposit hits so why did you apply for the role if it was that bad there are people working immense amount of hours to afford food and a roof over their heads and she's complaining about this I hate it when people whine over jobs they personally signed up for anyways loves make sure to click on the tab above for more juicy videos on these

02/24/2023,Liam Hemsworth REACTS To Miley Cyrus EXPOSING Him?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYWWjCt3qRs,99-19,we recently talked about how Liam Hemsworth is dating Miley Cyrus's ex background dancer Gabriella Brooks there are even rumors going around that Liam allegedly cheated on Miley with Gabriella which explains why people are dragging Liam left and right on social media and why Miley's new song flowers is getting the praise it deserves now the question is are the rumors about Liam cheating actually true or is Miley's management team trying to pull a marketing tactic just to promote the song we're gonna find out the truth in just a minute but for now let's adjust what went down recently between Miley and Liam in my previous video about Miley we talked about how Miley and Liam first met and how things escalated between them to the point where they both filed for a divorce after years of trying to stay together now we all know that Miley recently released a new song flowers and to be honest there have been some accusations going around that Miley allegedly had Easter eggs in her music video to throw shade at her ex-husband Liam these accusations came after people noticed a pattern in Miley's new music video after she wore a black suit which allegedly referred to the viral clip of Liam telling her to behave on the red carpet back in 2019. other than this people also thought that Miley intentionally released flowers on Liam's birthday which was the 13th of January but again these could all just be speculations now if you go back to my previous video you know that I addressed all the connections that people made about Miley allegedly shading Liam in her new song and music video and well despite some of them being over exaggerated a lot of her fans believe that Miley referred to her old Malibu house with Liam that they used to live in before it got ravaged by California wildfires after she said it in her song we were right till we weren't built a home and watched it burn but what made me question this entire drama going around is when news outlets started randomly reporting that Liam once dedicated Bruno Mars's song When I Was Your Man to Miley which is why Miley's new song flowers seem to respond directly to that song's lyrics the the reason why I'm questioning all of this you guys is because Miley's sister Brandy recently spoke up about the rumors going around flowers being a response to Liam and despite her stating in the interview that the speculations could be true she also mentioned that all the narratives fans are making about the situation are making it seem that Miley is a genius so it's funny because yeah the song did come out on his birthday was that on purpose I don't know can't say genius though and the fans I love Miley fans so much they go hard in the paint they go hard in the paint the fans on Tick Tock just keep creating narrative after narrative and it is so funny it makes Miley seem like an absolute genius and it's just too good like every day I wake up to a new one like it's up to people whether they believe the whole situation is a PR or not because self said that happen because it gets people talking and well this turned out to be true because shortly after Miley's fans started all these narratives about the situation the song flowers became the fastest song to reach 100 million streams in Spotify history and y'all it even debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 with 425k sales to be honest I'm not even mad about the fans or Miley's team starting this PR behind the scenes because the way this song is doing numbers right now speaks a lot about her dedicated fans but for the most part I feel like some of these fans were going way too far with their narratives to the point where the pr stopped working after they continued creating fake accusations about Miley such as her allegedly dressing like Liam's ex-girlfriend Jennifer Lawrence in her music video and to make this even worse some fans even assumed that the house Miley used for her music video was previously owned by Liam to cheat on her with 14 women while they were married no shade I don't understand where these fans were getting all this information from but I guess it was working like magic for my Kylie because her song was doing wonders and breaking tons of Records anyways a couple of days after these speculations started going viral Liam and his new girlfriend Gabriella Brooks were spotted returning home from a romantic weekend getaway in Mexico and well despite this being completely awkward considering the fact that they showed up post the release of the song the paparazzi allegedly confirmed that Liam was showcasing a low profile and trying to dodge them just to avoid any obvious questions about Miley and her song even though this could be true some fans went on social media to point out that Liam could have been avoiding the paps just to hide his girlfriend Gabriella from the public and the reason why so many fans believe it's true is because of Gabriella's past in case you missed it Gabriella used to work for Miley back in 2013. after she was used as a backup dancer for Miley's performances on stage and as awkward and insane as this is I feel embarrassed for Liam more than Gabriella because imagine how low you have to be in life to the point where you date your ex wife's worker now this isn't the case here unfortunately because despite how tragic and awful this actually is some fans are now accusing Liam of cheating on Miley with Gabriella back in 2019 but thanks to sources we have evidence that Loki proves it's false I can't believe I'm defending Liam now but anyways as you all know both Miley and Liam officially settled the details of their divorce in December 2019. they initially filed in August 2018 but their divorce was not finalized until February 2020. in the meantime Liam was linking up with Gabriella for the first time after they were photographed together in Australia back in 2019 where he introduced Gabriella to his parents and they were spotted getting the two with the hug at that moment everything seemed to be going pretty fast between them because in January 2020 A source told People magazine that Liam and Gabriella were getting serious and that they had spent a lot of time in Australia together such as exercising surfing and relaxing at the beach together a couple of days later the couple was spotted in Australia kissing on the beach and that's how their relationship became official to the public again I feel like the reason why Miley's fans assumed that he was cheating on her is because of how quickly he moved on from mine now no matter what source information we got from this situation no one really knows what went down behind the scenes between them but to accuse someone of cheating is a bit of a stretch to me not gonna lie and I feel like this whole drama was a way for fans to take revenge on Liam for Miley now what bothers me about this situation is that so many fans are going to Gabriella's Instagram page and leaving a ton of hate comments under her post telling her that Miley is better than her and that she is a homewrecker one fan wrote Miley is a talented beautiful and successful woman meanwhile Liam settled for Miley's ex-backup dancer it's so funny to me he finally found what he deserves jobless girl with no future and no career another one noticed the similarity and said Liam must really love Miley because he's dating a similar girl one fan also wrote Miley always supported you and you cheated with her husband this is not a good look for you Miley gave you Fame as well as Liam and if it weren't for Miley both of you guys wouldn't be famous it's low-key sad to see how fans immediately accept a rumor and start running with it as if it was proven to be true but for now we're still waiting for more information about this entire drama hopefully Miley opens up about it in her new album so both her fans and the general public can chill a bit anyways loves I would love to hear your opinions on this situation down below also don't forget to click on the tab for more

02/01/2023,Jenna Ortega Opens Up On Percy Hynes White DISGUSTING Actions..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPEV31tmbv8,97-16,y'all I can't believe the Netflix show Wednesday is threatened to be canceled after one of their main actors turned out to be a horrible person yes I'm talking about Percy Heinz white who not only got exposed by multiple victims for essay but for also being racist misogynist and even harassing and sending unsolicited pictures to teenage girls and Percy is now getting canceled on Twitter because of these allegations with so many people asking the show to be canceled so let's talk about them and address what really went down I don't think anyone expected a cast member from Wednesday especially Percy to get exposed all of a sudden for being a creep and having an extremely horrible past but before we get into all the details let's talk about Percy for a second and how he made fans fall in love with him in case you guys didn't know Percy Hines white is a 21 year old actor who was born in Canada and he was mostly known for his roles in films such as edge of winter and a Christmas horror story and also for his role in the television show shows between and the gifted for some reason Percy had never been in a main character role before in any show or movie despite years of him studying directing and acting and that's why he never gained fame or attention so quickly at the early stages of his career but all of this took a turn in 2022 when Netflix released the show Wednesday that Percy starred in and this show broke millions of records and became the most hours viewed in a week for a TV series Percy had a major role in the show Wednesday who played a suspected villain and for some reason people got attached to his character and the idea of him being sweet and caring in the show that he was starring in this boosted Percy's career immediately after he gained millions of followers on social media in a short amount of time and y'all so many people just fell in love with his personality in that show and his looks as well a couple of months after Percy gained all that attention from his show Wednesday Netflix decided to announce that they will be renewing the series for a second season due to its popularity and success but this announcement could all change in any second now after Percy got exposed by multiple victims for his horrible past the allegations towards him were first aired by Twitter user at miklovich who posted a thread where she claimed Percy's group of friends would throw parties where they would explicitly invite young women they thought were hot so they could get them drunk and high enough to sleep with them Percy lives in Toronto and he and his friend group has been known for since they were like 15 being creditors and trying to manipulate girls into [ __ ] them or giving them nudes Etc they were pushy rude abusive to girlfriends and girls and people in general and then when he got a bit older he started throwing parties in his basement planning with his friends to explicitly invite women they thought were hot so they could get them drunk and high enough to have sex with them and lie about being high and drunk as well at 17 to 2 at least from what I know he would pressure have sex with abuse and get my friend hi who is 13 14 at the time last time I knew they had she was 16 and he was 20. he has visited me at one of those parties while I was too drunk he had cornered and pressured and melted multiple of my friends he has allegations against him and he would laugh at victims share nudes online against girls Wills Etc the person continued exposing Percy for allegedly forcing a 16 year old to sleep with him while he was 20 and she explained how careless and selfish he was when it came to meeting girls and demanding to hook up with him after these screenshots got posted things took a wild turn once another victim came and said this knowing what he's done to me and other women is disgusting and y'all this is when a third victim stepped in to talk about her story after she claimed that Percy used to Fat shame her and make fun of her looks when they were friends and just when she wanted to confront him in the DMS on Instagram he blocked her immediately here's proof of when he blocked my spam account after deleting text messages from when he told me to keep myself and I was fat and ugly and he told me he hated his fans this is really disturbing ASF he hurts so many of my friends even though the victim didn't show any actual proof of Percy bullying her she still made one of her old friends open up about the time when Percy let her get in his basement by one of his friends it hurts to see this man in the public eye and admired by hundreds of thousands of young girls he let me get in his basement and when he called me about it he was most worried about the police and not if I was okay then he continued to let a best live at his mother's after the victim made those claims she went on Twitter and exposed old conversations between her and Percy about the situation in his basement and y'all just take a look at how Percy reacted once the victim opened up about how messed up it was for him to defend his friend instead of her nobody said you were lying I just need to make sure I hear it from everybody seeing as it's a super delicate situation and I've never had to do something like this before also just got accused of yeah imagine this being your response after your friend told you that she got R worded by one of your guy friends it's just messed up on so many levels and the fact that people didn't believe the victim at first was crazy because there are real pictures of Percy and the victim hanging out years ago when they they were friends anyways after this situation started to blow up on social media another person joined and decided to post a conversation she had with one of Percy's victims a couple of years ago and y'all in those texts the victim exposed Percy for sleeping with her at the age of 14. yeah apparently Percy knew the victim was only 14 since she used to lie about being 16 to the public but it doesn't end here you guys because so many victims started coming forward days later to share their experiences with Percy before his Fame and y'all this new victim shared how Percy used to throw parties intentionally just to Target young women including her sister real my sister went to a party with him back in High's CJ ohm and she said he was the most grossest human she had met and some of the tweets that have been coming forward are from people who my family knew so much tis truly horrible well from what I have heard from people who have in the past gone to parties he would get oddly close to people and make them highly uncomfortable I'm other than this Percy also used to send inappropriate pictures of him to groups of designers and you can clearly tell from these screenshots that it was actually him it's just crazy to see all these victims speaking up especially when the accusations against him keep getting worse and worse since another victim came forward and shared how she used to go to high school with Percy and how he used girls to his advantage and y'all he even used to send his fans to bullying harass girls online after another victim shared screenshots of Percy bullying her a few years back now unfortunately I can't really include all the victims in today's video since some of their stories were pretty sensitive but I want to shed a light on Percy being racist and fat phobic because there's also an old video of him saying a racist slur going viral on social media at the moment here are other screenshots of Percy's old Twitter account where he used to Fat shame women and make racist comments on it if you take the O out of onward it becomes an word racist here's a pic of Percy making fun of terrorism by wearing an Osama Bin Laden shirt and here's a screen recorded video of Percy following a white Supreme best pro-gun Instagram page and liking all their posts again I wish I could include more proof of Percy being a weirdo but I know for a fact that YouTube policy will try and get me for sure after all of these allegations towards Percy started receiving a lot of attention on Twitter hashtag cancel Percy began trending on social media for days with millions of fans asking Netflix to remove Percy from the show Wednesday if they ever made a second season removed from the show is bare minimum Batman committed crimes and should be going to jail I really hope they fire him someone like that can't be around a cast full of women he's a danger I really hope Percy pays for what he did he's disgusting instead of saying cancel Percy Hines white say arrest Percy Hines white he's a criminal not an influencer acting out Percy hine's wife's career lasted for two months LMFAO hope he goes to jail it's obvious that so many fans were Furious and upset about the entire situation and how Percy turned out to be a monster after he made millions of people fall in love with him but despite all that Percy did react to the entire accusations towards him by activating his Twitter account only and y'all even his mother waited on the situation and decided to defend her son by liking this tweet about Percy I think there is something true but not the monster that is being told maybe he was a horrible kid but now he's grown up and I don't think Jenna Georgie Katie are stupid and I see him as authentic crazy but lovely guy maybe I'm wrong I'm curious to see what happens with Percy's career in the next few months following these allegations but I'm gonna be 100 sure that they will be nothing but hell for him anyways loves make sure to click on the tab above for more

this situation down below but for now let's talk about Mal trevejo who claimed that she was black after she got called out for saying the n-word again I can't believe that we're still talking about Mal and trevejo being racist in 2023 but this time you guys things went pretty far after mallow made multiple claims and decided to offend the black community uh yeah as we all know Malu has a history of being racist towards different communities and races out there in fact she has probably said the n-word more than you could have possibly imagined there are even tons of videos of Malu accidentally lip singing the n-word while confidently saying it as well just check these out [Music] we are mine no but I want one oh she got called out multiple times for saying the n-word she always had excuses prepared to the point where she claimed that Latin people are allowed to say the n-word and that everyone in Miami says it as well so let me say there's a lot of rappers that are Dominicans that always saying what can I say [Music] because the mini kids in Cuban are almost the same they're Latinos my little [ __ ] since we are the same call me racist for a word that in Miami people say it as a bro if you see me using it as a disrespectful way I'll give you the doubt about yourself and my needs and say you right I understand her obsession with saying that slur and if you thought that was bad the situation didn't end there because aside from her getting dragged for appropriating the entire Black Culture for years and years this week she got dragged again for lip syncing the n-word in a new tick tock video and y'all her excuse for saying it this time was actually horrifying [ __ ] Egyptian that makes so much [ __ ] sense right now I'm an Egyptian I'm so [ __ ] glad I did this DNA says I'm not even gonna lie are you [ __ ] were providing me for saying that word and this whole time I'm learning more black than what I am Spanish it's crazy hold on it's more Egyptian than Latino which excuse the question is who told her that Egyptians are actually black I don't understand what point she's trying to make by saying that she's more black than Latino I seriously can't with this girl anymore what's this obsession with other races saying that word it's not hard to not say it istg this girl is a new ethnicity every year girl the majority of Egyptians can't even say the n-word she switches her ethnicity every month she's literally said she was Dominican Italian Moroccan before Miss worldwide for real anyways you guys let's just end today's video with Lauren Gray exposing her boyfriend for cheating on her with another girl I don't want to be this type of person but if I looked like Lauren Gray and I got cheated on by someone who looked busted I would have ended it all no joke I literally don't understand men anymore because how are you gonna cheat on the Lauren Gray who has literally drop dead gorgeous and keep in mind this isn't the first time that Lauren has gone through such a thing after she expose her boyfriend Dyson who two years ago cheated on her at Coachella with random girls finding out your ex was cheating on you from some random girls at Coachella anyways this all went down when fans noticed how both Lauren and her boyfriend Ari Elkins unfollowed each other on all social media platforms and on top of this fans even noticed how Lauren removed all of her pictures with Ari on her Instagram page as well of course this started a huge rumor on social media that Lauren and Ari were no longer together although for some reason their fans were trying their best to hold tight to the tiny strand of Hope after they realized that Ari was still following Lauren's spam page on Instagram and y'all even their pictures together were still up on his page a couple of days after this rumor started making headlines on social media Lauren decided to put an end to it by exposing Ari in a Tick-Tock video for cheating on her and let's just take a look at what she said in her caption it's always the one he told you not to worry about shortly after Lauren posted this video on her spam account her entire fan base began throwing tons of Hita Ari for allegedly cheating on Lauren but of course Ari filtered his comment section and decided to delete the hate comments instead so here's what a few people had to say about the whole situation nah cause this is her second time being cheated on she deserves so much better she really doesn't deserve this she always ends up getting played by these types of guys like imagine cheating on Lauren bye Lauren is literally the most Gorge girl I've ever seen is lost for real anyways loves if you need more juicy videos on these influencers then make sure to click on the tab right above

09/25/2022,Dhar Mann Has Officially Lost His Mind..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrLX6wjY1Ws,32-22,I don't know if you guys have ever seen a channel called Darman a lot of you probably have since his videos get millions of views every single day but for some reason I have only just found out about his channel and honestly my life was so much better before I was aware of this channel if you haven't heard of him before Darman makes videos on a lot of different topics they're mostly acted out as short stories with a moral at the end which doesn't seem like anything revolutionary when you first hear about them but sometimes the videos themselves are absolutely crazy and darches goes way too far to the point that I am literally left speechless Starman is an entrepreneur that set up his YouTube channel back in 2018. when you look at his channel he says in his own words we're not just telling stories we're changing lives I mean that's quite a bold statement to make when all your channel contains are the most random role play scenarios however he also mentions in the description of his channel that he draws from his own experiences with success and failure so already before actually watching any of his videos I had my standards set pretty high but girl I have never had my emotions played with so horribly in all my life pretty much every single one of his videos has the same title it will start with a completely random scenario like mean girl humiliates quiet teen and then almost always the title will finish with what happens next is shocking or and they...
