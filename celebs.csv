04/04/2023,Kim Kardashian SCAMMED This Man of $400M?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUHyrssFzEE,114-15,you know it's kind of crazy that the Kardashians keep making headlines every week but this time you guys things are getting pretty serious because it involves Kim Kardashian ruining a man's life to the point where he became homeless after she sued him for millions of dollars this is a story about a man called David liebenson who had been going viral on the internet for the last couple of weeks after citizens noticed this sign all around La that said Kim Kardashian ruinedmylife.com now you might be asking a lot of questions as to who made the sign why it spread all over LA and where does this website take you and to answer your questions we have to get to the root of the problem because so far people have been taking sides with both Kim and David and there's a lot of fake narratives going around that need to be shut down so I think the majority of you guys know about Kim's kimoji brand and if you don't then you probably haven't been on the internet for a while because years ago Kim Kardashian launched an applique education called kimoji where you can use reaction pictures and gifs of the Kardashians from their reality TV show including Kim and her family the app you guys became a huge success in the market and by that I mean it became the top seller on the App Store after it received 9 000 downloads per second and earned about 1 million dollars per minute just imagine how big this application actually was I mean everyone on social media back in 2014 was using kimoji to send gifts and meme pictures of the Kardashians and guess what Kim was earning millions of dollars in minutes from it without even lifting a finger but the truth about all of this you guys is that the app wouldn't have existed without David liebenhosen who is the man who created the website Kim Kardashian ruinedmylife.com David is a software startup founder who met with Kim Kardashian at her house back in 2014 to set up a software startup that he founded of course Kim was interested in working with David so she decided to follow along with him as they both discuss different business plans and ideas that could work for the team and during their meeting you guys David came up with an idea to launch an app called kimoji where fans used meme pictures of the Kardashians on their phones at first the startup idea was completely unrelated to kimoji but after David pitched his idea to Kim and showed her a mock-up version of the concept both Kim and her mother Chris agreed to the project and decided to share their excitement through text which you can see right in front of your screen sky is the limit on emojis and its name is trademarked just in case we can re-trade Mark if necessary amazing I for sure want to move forward I will have my list of emojis and some changes on the pick but let's get started here's where things began going downhill because after David and Kim became business partners and made a deal to launch the application they both agreed on splitting any money they made from the app kimoji 5050 and after that David proceeded to send even more mock-ups of kimojis to Kim as shown in the picture and to be honest from the looks of it it seemed that David was very passionate about launch teaching this project with Kim but all this excitement died down once a member of Kim Kardashian's team called David to ask whether he had trademarked the idea about kimoji or not and when David said no Kim's team then proceeded to tell David that there will be a lot of trouble if he filed the trademark by himself and that it would be better if they helped him out with it right after David agreed he got a call from Kim the next day where she told David that she wanted to back out of the deal by using some lame excuse and of course David was left completely shocked in a matter of days Kim was able to steal David's idea from right under his nose trademark it and launched the app herself and the worst part about it is that David wasn't able to do anything regarding it since Kim team had already filed a trademark and theoretically the trademark now belongs to Kim Kardashian although this doesn't mean that David has no paper trail to prove that he was the one that came up with the idea because on his website you can find tons of pictures that confirm that alongside text messages between him and Kim now unfortunately David got hit with a counter suit from Kim back in 2019 after he attempted to sue her for a hundred million dollars for stealing the idea of kimoji but somehow Kim managed to counter Sue David for 400 million instead and for that David had to sit back down and stay quiet for years you guys Kim used her wealth power and connections to prevent David from speaking out and ruining her career and businesses but this year David finally had the courage to tell his side of the story after he launched a website called Kim Kardashian ruinedmylife.com where he exposed Kim for stealing his idea and making millions of dollars from it of course it was a huge struggle for David to promote the website since he didn't have any following or people that supported him but after he started going around La and spreading multiple signs in the streets with his website on them people started catching up and became interested in his story and that's how the incident went viral again on social media this week these days David is not only homeless but he's also living out of his car as he claimed on his website and if you go to his Instagram account you can see that he grew a huge amount of following but he's currently working on the website to add more information to the story as he wrote this on his bio click the link below to learn more I am updating content as I have time site is all built on iPhone content here soon a lot of people are currently supporting David right now as not only are they sharing his website on social media but they're also donating to David to give him a little push to reopen the case and get Justice we're not sure if Kim has any knowledge about the situation whatsoever but based on the tick tock videos being posted and the news articles reporting on the incident everyone seems to be talking about the mess that Kim got involved in with David and from the looks of it a lot of people are hoping that Kim will step down and reveal the truth either way y'all this situation is still leaving people with mixed opinions as some of them are bullying Kim for stealing from David While others are blaming David for not signing a contract and filing a trademark before Kim went out of her way to do that here is some people had to say um who goes into a business meeting to share an idea with billionaires without having an attorney guiding you business is business she should pay up I hope she gets Karma one day he never would have got a trademark for her image and name is he for real she would have beat him in court if he tried that family is really demonic I don't believe this sorry I would love to hear your comments on this situation down below

04/05/2023,How Selena Gomez Manipulated Hailey Bieber to APOLOGIZE!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iHxETwMN5E,115-14,despite how Haley Bieber and Selena Gomez addressed their issue together earlier last week some fans are still finding ways to heat on Haley and accuse her of being a bully only this time her husband Justin is in the middle of the entire drama yeah yeah that's exactly what we need right now I can't remember if it's been a month since this whole Selena versus Haley Bieber beef started but from what we've seen it doesn't seem that this drama is gonna end anytime soon since not only celebrities are still speaking up about it but even some of them are taking advantage of it just to get sympathy from the media like how far could this whole thing go honestly with that being said you guys let's just jump right in and address the mess that you guys missed out on if you guys still remember in my previous videos we addressed how tons of popular brands and restaurants took advantage of hilly and Selena's drama and decided to profit off of it by bringing Haley down and to make it even worse we also saw Jeffree Star Throwing Shade at Haley as well after he went on Tick Tock to drag her beauty brand and admit that he is team Selena even though this was very unnecessary the hate towards Haley just couldn't stop you guys I mean millions of people were being entertained by watching Haley get dragged on the internet and to be honest part of the hate seemed pretty misogynistic to me especially men who went on social media platforms to drag Haley without having any clue what really happened like explain to me why doctors are now even siding with Selena on Tick Tock like don't y'all have like families to feed as you can see it went from people dragging Haley for bullying Selena to people straight up making fun of her for her looks for entertainment and of course we saw how people started comparing Haley's looks to an ear and Putin for some reason now Haley did clap back at people who were comparing her face shape to an ear and she decided to caption her new selfie picture an ear emoji just to make it seem that she was not affected by the hate that people were throwing at her it just felt that Haley was trying so hard to put on an act that she's this brave and strong woman who doesn't care about what people have to say about her but clearly enough she was actually going through it during all of this drama especially when Selena went on social media this week to defend Haley from the hate that she's been receiving check this out Haley Bieber reached out to me and let me know that she has been receiving threats and such hateful negative this is not what I stand for no one should have to experience hate or bullying I've always advocated for kindness and really want this all to stop shortly after Selena made this statement she Then followed Haley Bieber on Instagram to make sure that her fans would stop hating on Haley however people on the other hand found it hella weird that Haley had the audacity to reach out to Selena for help to stop her fans from coming after her when she was the one who started this entire Mess by posting that cryptic Tick Tock video about her here's what some fans had to say Selena girl look at me this isn't you nah this doesn't sit right with me you don't always need to be the bigger person SMH Haley crying to Selena about her own actions that led to the hate she received is funny to me as soon as people began sharing their frustration over this entire situation of course Haley decided to make a response towards Selena by thanking her for speaking out and y'all she even refiled Selena on Instagram and wrote multiple paragraphs addressing how the last few weeks have been really hard on her and how she she will be more thoughtful about what she posts on the internet moving forward I want to thank Selena for speaking out as her and I have been discussing the last few weeks how to move past this ongoing narrative between her and I the last few weeks have been very hard for everyone involved and millions of people are seeing so much hate around this which is extremely harmful while social media is an incredible way to connect and build community moments like this only create extreme division instead of bringing people together things can always be taken out of context or construed differently than they were intended we all need to be more thoughtful about what we post and what we say including myself in the end I believe love will always be bigger than hate and negativity and there is always an opportunity to meet each other with more empathy and compassion in my personal opinion I feel like Kelly's response this time was really genuine and I'm not saying that she's fully innocent in the case because we all know that some of her actions were hella toxic and childish but if we're being completely honest I feel like the majority of the rumors and accusations that have gone viral on the internet were made up by fans who disliked Justin Bieber and for some reason his wife Haley got in the way and she started catching Strays left and right from the media although this doesn't justify the fact that Haley isn't a mean girl and a bully just because we've seen her actions over the years and this woman needs to seek help as soon as she can however fans are now concerned over Haley and Selena following each other on Instagram because as Petty as Haley might be she could potentially start posting her husband Justin more often on her page just to remind Selena of her past and that's why many fans encouraged Selena to unfall Haley just to forget about all of this mess despite all of that Selena didn't actually take the win in this situation you guys because most people on social media found her response towards Haley very hypocritical and disrespectful because it seemed that Selena had been waiting for Haley to message her about her fans sending the hate towards her to make her feel embarrassed hence why she started her response with Haley Bieber reached out to me and y'all some people even pointed out that Selena herself had been feeding into the drama this entire time by actively commenting on shitty tick tocks about Haley only for her to defend Haley now to keep up her good girl image just take a look at what people had to say about this you know who could speak up and put an end to it Haley Bieber's husband LMAO but instead she had to reach out to the ex-girlfriend it's funny that she's acting as if she isn't the one who started all these drama the world needs to understand that she loves this kind of attention to stay relevant she literally waited until her fans dragged Haley every day for over a month till nothing's left before she spoke up to keep this innocent Angelic image in the public eye yeah I don't know how to feel about Selena's response because why would she pretend to be sneaky in this situation when she made Haley gain over 100k followers after she defended her I genuinely hope this entire drama is over now between these two because from what I've seen the fans are the main reason why this whole situation began in the first place and to me it seems like people love to pit women against each other in the industry now the question is have people actually forgiven Haley after Selena defended her um I wouldn't say that to be honest because a couple of days after Selena and Haley put an end to the drama people started accusing Haley of shading Selena again and this happened after Haley and her husband were seen at a sza concert where Haley seemed to be forcing Justin in this video to sing the lyrics to sizz's song Kill Bill which says I might kill my ex take a look at this video despite how a lot of people found it weird how Haley kept forcing Justin to sing the lyrics with her some people on the other hand thought that Justin knew that cameras were pointed at him and that's why he remained silent so people wouldn't make something out of it this explains why Justin didn't step in to defend his wife from fans dragging her online because he knows for a fact no matter what he says and does people are gonna hate on him and his wife regardless but with that being said Justine Skye aka the girl who was included in that shady Tick Tock video with Haley and Kendall decided to speak up and defend Haley from people hating on her still and y'all not only did she address the Shady Snapchat stories which she made about Selena years ago where she trashed her makeup brand and called her whack but she even expressed her frustration over people still hating on Haley despite Selena standing up for her I wasn't being shady I was being honest it's a crazy world we live in where nothing is enough for you all you guys have assumed enough and it's actually Beyond insane at this point it's been going on for over a month what the hell do you want to happen next for us to kill ourselves no one says anything because there is no winning with you all but I'm [ __ ] tired of this it doesn't matter what anyone says you guys don't want the truth to be real but the fact of the matter is you're all so wrong and for the millionth time I never said anything about her ever you can be like who would hack Justin Skye who are you even but someone did and it was one of you because you've done it before in the past so I know you're very proud of yourself for succeeding good for you for real the only thing I'm actually sorry for is that you believe that respectfully God bless from seeing people defending Haley to literally switching up on her in a second Justine kind of lost hope in defending her image to the public anymore and it feels like she almost gave up trying to prove herself every time we still have no idea whether Justine made those Snapchat stories about Selena or not but based on people's proof those screenshots are most likely true I would love to hear your opinion on this issue education down below but for now make sure to click on the tab above for more juicy videos on these celebrities 
03/24/2023,Hailey Bieber THANKS Selena Gomez..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18jUmJ8hqog,116-10,it's been a month and Haley Bieber has finally spoken out about this whole situation and she's come forward to her Instagram story to thank Selena for defending her against all the backlash she's been getting this morning if you guys aren't caught up with this whole situation on Friday morning Selena Gomez shared a message to her Instagram story and it was revolving the entire drama that's been going on with her and Haley over these last two months if you guys haven't watched my previous video I'll link that down below as a quick recap but Selena shared a message saying that she and Haley have spoken and she was pretty much asking her fans to quit sending her hate and Haley Bieber reached out to me and let me know that she has been receiving and such hateful negativity this isn't what I stand for no one should have to experience hate or bullying I've always advocated for kindness and really want this all to stop and it's now been about seven hours later and Hayley Bieber has went over to her Instagram story and confirmed that her Aunt Selena did talk things out and that they're on good terms and she made a lengthy statement with some more things to address about the situation she said I want to thank Selena for speaking out as her and I have been discussing the last few weeks how to move past this ongoing narrative between her and I the last few weeks have been very hard for everyone involved and millions of people are seeing so much hate around this which is extremely harmful while social media is an incredible way to connect and build community moments like this only create extreme division instead of bringing people together things can always be taken out of context or construed differently than they were intended we we all need to be more thoughtful about what we post and what we say including myself in the end I believe love will always be bigger than hate and negativity and there is always an opportunity to meet each other with more empathy and compassion heart emoji now I do want to update you guys on Justine Skye which if you don't know she is Haley Bieber's close friend and she's been getting called out as well throughout this entire situation because people thought that she was shading Selena Gomez not too long ago and just siding with Haley because she is her best friend so three days ago Justine Skye posted a story on her Snapchat story basically shading Selena Gomez and fans took this as Selena Gomez or I'm sorry just seen Skye protecting her friend Haley Bieber from Selena Gomez as we all know the controversy of you know Selena Gomez being Justin Bieber's ex Haley Bieber being the wife that love triangle and that controversy or that fans speculate this is the story that she posted that got everybody riled up um basically saying that she was basically shading rare Beauty which is Selena Gomez's makeup brand and then she posted this one throwback with my wifey I'll protector at all cost Haley Bieber that's her people were also attacking Haley Bieber as well saying that Haley Bieber was egging Justine on to post these things to cause controversy to get at Selena for I don't know her past stuff with Justin a few hours after Selena posted her statement Justine Skye decided to issue a statement as well over to her Twitter she also shared that she was getting from a lot of people to her iPhone message this is the Tweet Justine Skye made in regards to all the backlash she's been getting about being shady towards Selena Gomez in the past and just overall trying to defend her best friend she said I wasn't being shady I was being honest it is a crazy world we live in where nothing is enough for you all you guys have assumed enough and it's actually Beyond insane at this point it's been going on for over a month what the hell do you want to happen next for us to kill ourselves no one says anything because there is no winning with you all but I'm effing tired of this it doesn't matter what anyone says you guys don't want the truth to be real but the fact of the matter is you're all so wrong wrong for instigating and perpetuating this horrible narrative wrong for not only spewing hate on the internet but also having to deal with it in real life this isn't a game and it's no longer funny you're probably going to find some something wrong with this too I'm sure but go ahead she then denied all the Shady things by saying and for the millionth time I never said anything about her ever you can be like who would hack Justine Skye who are you even but someone did so it seems like she is trying to imply that her account was hacked when she was trying to shape Selena throughout that time she continued and it was one of you because you've done it before in the past so I know you're very proud of yourself for succeeding good for you for real but that's not something I would ever do as many of you don't even know me like you say all the time I've just been trying to ignore but I'm sick of this if you actually do care and support someone who lives by non-bullying and an advocate for mental health you would educate and not continue to spread the hate you believe was being given to her the only thing I'm actually sorry for is that you believe that respectfully and while a lot of people think that these are not justified in any way shape or form some people think that these two are trying to play victim in this situation and a lot of people are just saying that Selena was The Classy one throughout the situation all around but I want to know what you guys think Haley Bieber's best friend Justine Skye just ruined The Mending between Selena and Haley after Haley had reached out to Selena Gomez Justine Skye tweeted what a world we live in a and then immediately deleted it please note that Justine has previously been shading Selena you can pause to read her statement after deleting that tweet following her rant she then tweeted these pictures saying how her number got leaked or something Justine shouldn't be getting hate either but she also needs to keep her mouth shut this now gives the whole Haley Bieber gang the opportunity to play the victim card let's remember this all started when they fat shamed Selena in a tick tock this is actually crazy to me Haley reaches out to Selena and asks her to make a statement to end the drama that Haley and her friends started and then once the statement is posted Justine Skye who is Haley's friend runs to Twitter to make a comment about it this tweet was deleted very quickly after it was posted and Justine Skye is someone who has shaded Selena many times before and I just don't understand what these girls want from Selena she's defended you when she really didn't have to considering you Troll and her on the regular and then she makes a statement and it's not enough these girls are top tier gaslighters and manipulators and Selena is just too pure and too nice for this and I'm just sad about it anyways guys this has been the update on Haley and her statement I definitely want to know what you guys think about this entire situation in the comments down below hopefully this is the end of all this madness there's a lot of people seeing that there's something deeper going on behind the scenes and some even speculating that they were forced to kind of make amends by their PR but who really knows at the end of the day definitely let me know your thoughts on this situation in the comments down below I love you guys so much and as always I'll see you all in the next video [Music] thank you [Music] foreign 
03/24/2023,Selena Gomez Defends Hailey Bieber (Hailey reached out),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVnPs3wRjNg,130-18,I honestly thought this story was behind us seriously you guys I really did but I guess it wasn't and Haley Bieber has still been getting non-stop hate since all of this started where people felt like she was bullying Selena things sort of kind of chilled out in terms of Publications reporting on it and people talking about it online but her comment section hasn't really lightened up and if you look at it people are still threatening her and they're coming at her and they're just saying a bunch of stuff and Selena has now as a result come out to defend Haley in an official statement on her Instagram story telling people to back off from her she posted bright and early Friday morning Haley Bieber reached out to me and let me know that she has been receiving death threats in such hateful negativity this isn't what I stand for no one should have to experience hate or bullying I've always advocated for kindness and really want this all to stop this is truly something I never thought I would see but it's clear Selena wants this hate against Haley to stop especially if people are coming for Haley because they claim they want to defense lean as an aim which is true like a lot of people are saying that they want to defend Selena but Selena at the same time has said many times that she does not support hate and she has been on Tick Tock live several times saying she does not want people to associate her name with hate and if people support her or they support her brand they are also subscribing to the message that she is preaching and putting out there and she doesn't include bringing other people down in the messages that she is wanting those people to receive and or send out I do not stand for women tearing women down that you just feel in the moment and just please for me know that that's not my heart and my heart is only to release things that I feel that are me and that I'm proud of no one ever should be spoken to in a manner that I've seen and all I have to say is it's incredibly ironic that I would release something that is all about kind words because that's exactly what I want that's it if you support rare I cannot thank you enough that know that you are also representing what it means and that is words matter it's interesting to hear that Healy actually was the one to reach out to Selena directly about all of this and I'm really surprised that Justin hasn't said anything in regards to this whole situation but maybe he knows it won't do anything because he has defended her in the past and we are still in this situation talking about it today we can clearly see that as much as Haley has been silent on the subject this has all been affecting her very deeply to the point that she has wanted to reach out to Selena because for the last few weeks Haley hasn't said anything she's kept it business as usual she's been promoting her Rhodes skin care she's been posting photos with Justin everything has been moving very much normally on her own Instagram in terms of the post that she has been putting out there but her comment section are telling a very different story and people were not letting her forget about all that has been going on and it's very clear that it really was affecting her seeing all that stuff but this whole situation situation with Selena actually defending Haley is reminding me of the time when Haley was on the call her daddy podcast and they were talking about the hate that Haley gets and Alex was kind of saying that she felt like it would make sort of a difference if Selena were to post something publicly to let others know that her and Haley are all good like commenting a heart on something or anything and Haley was just saying that you know they've never asked Selena to do anything like that and she's under the impression that Selena felt like saying something might not actually fix things so it's super interesting to see that this time right now the situation was so bad that she actually did reach out and try to get these messages towards her to stop by reaching out to Selena at any point did Justin or any literally anyone ever ask his ex to help put an end to the harassment that her fans put you through no what I will say is that she has been in this industry much longer than I have and maybe there's something that she knows about like it wouldn't fix anything I think like a nice little heart on your Tick Tock could end it all in the same interview Haley went on to say that Selena doesn't owe her anything and they are all just trying to live their lives separated from this drama because the three of them are somehow just like always connected by history and she feels like the reason why Selena hasn't said anything is because she is trying to like detach herself from this love triangle but to see that that's not the case anymore is very very interesting the thing is too is like I think that like all everyone is just trying to like create separation even though there's clearly like not always separation I have no expectation I would never expect someone to do that for me like she doesn't owe me anything I don't know neither of us owe anybody anything except like respect I respect her a lot and I think that like there's just no expectations if that was something that she felt was necessary then that would be amazing but I I just yeah I respect her there's no drama personally I think it says a lot that Selena really did post about Haley and directly tell people do not send her hate on my behalf I think it's true that addressing it really does draw a lot of attention to this Haley Selena Justin triangle that they're all trying to leave behind but it's very clear that it was just very serious for Haley to have to reach out to Selena and Selena is taking this very seriously as she has said before she does not want people to get hate at her expense but now the hate has kind of shifted a little bit from Haley and now people are looking at Justin even though like a couple weeks ago people were like free Justin Justin wear red shirt if you're being held hostage and like you don't actually love your wife and all this stuff but now people are like I can't believe Justin didn't defend Haley how embarrassing like all this stuff questioning why he never stood up for Haley and all of this I personally think I know matter what Justin would have said people would have just made jokes about how Haley was the one who typed out the message that he wrote or they would have just said that he was forced to do it obviously I do think that it would have been a very nice gesture if he said literally anything to defend her but saying nothing although you would think wouldn't cause any problems has kind of made him the butt of the joke now that Selena has with a ton of people online saying things like Selena Gomez really defended Haley Bieber again before her own husband did now that's embarrassing Haley had to reach out to Selena Gomez to defend her because her husband didn't I can't make this up the fact that Selena Gomez defended Haley Bieber more times than her husband the fact that Selena has been bullied by Haley and her husband's stance throughout the years but didn't say nothing and now she's even defending the girl publicly more than her husband ever could I know Haley was embarrassed when she had to ask Justin for Selena's new number no but imagine the Napa wife call calling Selena and crying to her is so funny instead of asking her husband to defend her she went back to Selena whom she's bullied for years Selena Gomez showing the world again how kind she is people are also saying that none of Haley's friends seem to have come to her defense either some of them have come out and cheated Selena but none of them have really come out to say leave Haley alone or Haley's a great person and she doesn't deserve any of this like none of them have really suddenly a lot which has people kind of feeling for her a little bit like her friends and your husband aren't trying to make some of this hate tie down it's all left up to Selena like that's a lot and who knows if this message will even help Haley at all I'm not sure just based off of the internet's reactions to it if this is like a good thing or a bad thing for her but one thing is for sure and that's just I never thought I would see Haley Bieber's full name on Selena Gomez's Instagram story but here we are and hopefully the three of them can just live their lives now and there won't be any like subtle or maybe could be interpreted shade Haley is throwing anymore because this whole thing just got really really crazy the girls are both following each other now and I'm sure that's to let everybody know that they're good on good terms and trying to keep the peace somehow some way between fandoms and hopefully it does kind of keep up so everyone can just like live their own lives but on the topic of Selena I will mention this this has nothing to do with Haley or Justin but last night as I was scrolling my way on Tick Tock I did see that there was this viral Tick Tock going around of news that Selena had dinner with Zayn Malik this girl said that her and her friends both work at restaurants and her friend texted her who is at her restaurant and said are you ready for this I'm screaming what I'm scared what happened tell me how Selena Gomez and Zayn walk into blank hand in hand making out and I seated them whatever I'm about to tell you guys you heard it here first so I'm on my way home from work and I'm a Hostess in New York City and I have a friend who's also a Hostess and we both work in restaurants that celebrities sometimes go to and tell me why she just sent me this text message and I checked if they even follow each other and as you can see Zayn only follows 18 people Selena being one of them but there weren't actually photos of them going on this little date so who knows if they like snuck out the back door or something I don't know but all I'm gonna say is that if this is true I'm happy for Selita and it's just interesting that this happens on the same night that I guess Haley reached out to her but that's what's been going on with these ladies as of right now let me know what you guys think about what Selena had posted in the comments and what you guys think about her and Zayn together I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys [Music] thank you 
03/22/2023,North West Gets BACKLASH on TikTok because of This..?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KgZ8NDQbdE,117-17,the internet is currently in complete uproar about Northwest tick tocks with ice spice and we have to talk about it people are seriously coming for North because of these tick tocks and somehow Kanye West got involved too like usual it's all turned into a classic Kardashian West sized Scandal if you don't know what I'm talking about North has been gushing all over ice spice and Kim decided it's time for her little angel to meet her Idol Kim invited ice spice to their house and Northern her friends had a literal dance party with her they even posted several tick tocks together to Mark the meeting the whole thing was so wholesome I mean imagine how happy meeting your childhood star would make you but unfortunately we can never have anything nice on the internet and there was some mixed reactions to this meeting okay to be fair most people thought it was cute at first and they thought this was a great thing for both ice spice and North leaving comments like this is so unexpected but I'm loving it oh I spice got that new generation audience she's only gonna get bigger and she just said I spice was one of her faves like this is too cute and some people also started joking about the situation like thinking that ice spice was edited in or saying that ice spice was basically babysitting all harmless Twitter jokes since this was a pretty unexpected meeting but others weren't as happy about it or As Nice there's been comments comparing ice spice to a party clown just because they think it was wrong of Kim to hire her to hang out with her daughter and they also accused her for using North to get attention but honestly we don't even know if she was paid for this maybe ice spice just loved that North was a big fan and wanted to make her happy by visiting I'm sure we all remember the adorable drawing North made a while ago that caught I spice's attention and Kim really doesn't need to use a nine-year-old to get attention she gets enough of that just by blinking besides that people also thought the interaction was somehow inappropriate because of the song's lyrics but let's be real you guys we are all singing and dancing to songs way worse than this when we were kids the only difference is that Tick Tock didn't exist to take our fun away from us why blame North for this when so many other kids her age probably listen to the same songs or even worse ones it seems completely unfair to be mad at this situation when they were just having fun in their own house and come on you guys the songs not even that explicit the good thing is that a lot of people came to North's defense about this and started sharing their own childhood experiences with songs deemed inappropriate for children which were super innocent to them I was North's age singing Anaconda she'll be all right and someone actually even pointed out a similar situation which was considered cute at the time Sophia Grace and Rosie were performing Super Bass on The Ellen Show at eight and five BTW no one said they were too young to be singing and dancing to adult songs and they were younger than North is now but because it's about the Kardashians everyone suddenly has a problem it's really not weird unless you make it weird like like this is just a child having fun which by the way it's like everyone forgets that North is only nine what's with the hate train North has had plenty of guests in her tick tocks like lizzo and even Mariah Carey and it's been extremely wholesome to witness Kim is always there as well making sure her daughter is having a great time and I have to admit it's pretty cute but Mariah didn't cause this big of an outrage when she appeared in the video granted it is Mariah Carey but this is also the ice spice anyways the situation actually didn't end there as North posted another Tick Tock about ice spice but y'all she was Ice spice this time North fully dressed up as her wig and all and was singing along to boys a liar with her friends yet again I mean she really went all in for this one she even has the Big Chain it's kind of iconic not gonna lie but this caused even more of an uproar than before especially because people started getting Kanye involved and saying that Kim was a bad mom for letting North dress up as her favorite singer someone even tweeted Kanye needs custody ASAP it got crazy because nothing this family does is ever kept in the DMS Kanye actually posted a video about his thoughts on his daughter's Tick Tock account when him and Kim first split up just got off the phone with Kim I told her to stop antagonizing me with this Tick Tock thing I said it's never again I am her father I know y'all don't respect fathers and the idea of family and media tries to promote something I said I am not allowing my daughter to be used by Tick Tock people are now referring back to this video and even saying that Kanye was right to be worried about North's Tick Tock account Kanye was right there's no way a nine-year-old should be idolizing ice spice and listening to her music about twerking and having sex men Kim is a terrible parent guys let's take a second to remember what kind of songs Kanye makes and let's compare the two which is really the worst year it's pretty hypocritical however Kanye is still North's dad and he does have a say in this situation he's not wrong about the internet being a dangerous place for children but come on this was just a little dress up it's super innocent and there was nothing wrong with it besides Kim has access to the account as well and she monitors everything North does on there she even deleted some of the videos North originally posted just to avoid more of this drama there's only one currently left probably to not ruin North's memory of the fun day she had she even turned off the comments for the account just so North won't be exposed to what negative comments have to say since they really just made the whole thing worse in my opinion North doesn't deserve this entire drama that has been created around these innocent tick tocks if everyone stopped being weird about it from the start then maybe this wouldn't have escalated so much this situation just got worse and worse and when people started forgetting who this was actually about it's not about Kim and Kanye it's about a child playing around and North loves posting her little Tech talks bringing Kanye into it just isn't fair towards Kim since they made it into something it really wasn't just to get an excuse to hate on Kim's parenting skills something else that has been an issue ever since she became a mother in the first place and it's not fair to North either everything she does doesn't have to be about her parents and it's actually pretty sad to see that everything she posts becomes over-analyzed and hated on someone even pointed out how social media platforms have actually turned these completely normal things into something weird for no reason I'm so glad my generation got to fully enjoy our childhood right before the social media boom hit y'all so cruel to children doing child-like things in a way the unnecessary backlash has probably done more harm than if she was just left to do these things in peace and in a surprising turn of events for the haters it actually turns out that North dressed up as ice spice for a school event it wasn't even because of tick tock and it wasn't just because she came over to visit a reality TV star masika stepped forward to explain the situation and stopped the hate in an Instagram comment today is Heroes and Heritage day at their school students are invited to participate in a spirit wear day inspired by February's Black History Month March's women's history month and World Language is week students are encouraged to dress in clothing celebrating their heroes or Heritage and North probably chose ice spice because she was cool and she loved her music and there's nothing else to it and I'm sure ice spice was super excited to see North celebrate her like that I mean North even Drew her for the second time after their meeting and posted it on Tick Tock clearly she loves her so much in the past North even dressed up as her dad in a tick tock video with Kim where she actually got just as much backlash because people thought Kim was using North to get to Kanye but this really doesn't seem to be the case since North actually did it again a few days later but with her friends instead it's clear North just loves to dress up especially like people she looks up to but it looks like no matter what she does she can't do it in peace especially since people are being just as weird about her dressing up as her dad as they are about her dressing up as ice spice it's super sad to see actually north has a long history of dressing up as her dad especially throwback to this iconic Roblox Style Halloween costume she and Saint wore for Halloween years ago and nobody had a problem with that one so why is everyone making such a big deal out of it now despite all the outrage on social media Kanye actually stood back without getting himself involved perhaps he's learning to finally keep things private when things don't concern the rest of us and this definitely seems like a family matter besides Kanye actually took North out to Universal Studios with his new wife Bianca sensory who he married barely two months after his divorce I don't know about you but that seems crazy fast and apparently it's not even a legal marriage since they don't have an actual marriage certificate yet anyway whatever Kanye had to say to North he probably said it in person and honestly North might have gotten a bit of a scolding because she didn't look to be very happy According to some pictures that were taken of the group or maybe North isn't too happy about her new stepmom according to sources Kanye and Bianca were just strolling around looking like two lovebirds holding hands while North was just trailing along this trip might have been more for Kanye's sake than for North's especially since it doesn't seem like they do a lot of things together in public like guys this is only the second time they've been spotted together out and about and the first time was at a restaurant in Malibu where North looked pretty sad sitting in the back of the car they don't seem to be having the greatest time together despite how desperate Kanye is for her love and attention maybe North really does miss her dad unlike Kanye Kim has been indulging her in everything she wants and at this point it wouldn't surprise me if dressing up as Kanye was 100 North's idea and Kim showed that she'd do anything for her daughter even getting her her personal ice spice concert that's just called being a good mother in my eyes Kanye might want to take some notes instead of fighting with Kim all day long anyways loves I would love to hear your opinions on the situation since everyone seems so split and make sure to click above if you're interested in more drama 
03/12/2023,COMPANIES are DRAGGING Hailey Bieber,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5RlSlja_lE,132-13,look at what my Starbucks has for their tip jars Selena or Harry beautiful Starbucks at the end of February of 2023 everyone's for you page on Tick Tock was flooded with the Haley Bieber versus Selena Gomez drama a lot of people started scrutinizing Haley Bieber's treatment of Selena Gomez amid speculation that Haley had been subtly Throwing Shade at Selena on her social medias for years as a result of all this Selena had gained 10 million followers on her Instagram while Haley on the other hand lost hundreds of thousands this drama had been going on for weeks on end and Selena especially has tried to encourage fans to move on from the drama but it doesn't seem like that's the route we're really headed towards this drama has only flared up as companies and brands are chiming into this drama as well brick and mortar stores like Starbucks Dutch Bros and so much more had their own touch to this drama some people are here for it but others think that this isn't a good idea especially during women's history month they think that all this is doing is a rallying up these two women against each other and a lot of people have their own thoughts and opinions about this but before we get into people's thoughts about this let's talk about what's actually been going on over this past week the other day it was International women's day and this tweet went pretty viral over on Twitter it was regarding the whole Haley and Selena drama and it said since it's women's history month here's every brand and company that has disgracefully engaged in the recent Witch Hunt of Haley Bieber this tweet included a thread and the thread include a number of big name brands on social media as well as in real life who decided to chime in on the drama and kind of shade Haley Bieber and this Twitter user was basically calling out every single one of these companies one by one starting off with Duolingo [Music] next on the thread was employees at Victoria's Secret and these two girls made a tick tock that went somewhat viral and they showed themselves ripping a poster of Haley Bieber in a model campaign and yeah the true oh um next on the list was facetune and then it was BuzzFeed and then it was Whataburger they tweeted we know you didn't ask but we're Team Selena Sonny do you even chimed in and they said nobody asked but team Selena now things started getting a little more serious when people decided to chime into this drama in real life at the end of the day this was all social media drama but come to find out that when people were playing up to their local Starbucks this was what they saw they saw two tip jars that were against each other one written Haley Bieber and the other written Selena Gomez and let me just say that a lot of people made sure to record themselves tipping in to Selena Gomez's cup making it clear to not only the Baristas that they were team Selena but also to people on Tick Tock I got five pieces of candy I got a chocolate bar I got a quarter I got a rock so right after I posted my two cents video on the whole Haley Salinas situation my best friend sends me a photo let the record reflect that only a franchise like Dutch Brothers if you know you know could carry this kind of energy through a celeb Feud like this are you it's the way there's literally nothing but coffee beans and Haley's cup for me us people saw other people recording themselves putting in their money and tips into the Selena Gomez drama and comparing the both of their jars a lot of other people decided to chime in and post their trip to their local Dutch Bros and Starbucks as well and surprisingly a lot of stores were chiming into this drama my Starbucks was too real for this and I'm not saying she deserved it but I'm saying God's timing is always right I can't read gotcha team Selena all the way gonna get my coffee team Selena team Haley I'm dead I have that thing whether it's a jar like why is that so funny I'm seeing Selena I hope they gave me an iced coffee because that's what I asked for all right now for me before it's happening because you're so pretty thank you you spill it out I can't see it so if you want to dip it I want to put towards King Selena don't worry thank you I just skipped it on accident Oh no you're fine that is so funny whoever put that are you taking Selena yes now there's been a whole nother debate though on whether this is actually the right thing for major companies and big name brands especially to involve themselves in some people think that with all these companies chiming in that this is only adding more fuel to the fire between Haley and Selena and thought this is kind of spreading the message of some people think this is just making the whole situation bigger than it should have been and a lot of people are just pointing out that this seems like these companies are rallying up the two women against each other one person on social media was really opposed to this whole idea to the point where they decided that they wanted to speak to the manager they said I couldn't believe what I saw with my own eyes today at a Starbucks stopped by a Starbucks today while out and about heading for a short visit enjoying my birthday my hubby was first to see it and be floored by it he was shocked at what it's been allowed to grow into I asked for the store number and name of the manager and will absolutely be calling and giving a piece of my mind when the older female employee at the window asked if there was a problem I pointed to the buckets and said what you were doing here is absolutely disgusting especially in today's world her reply most of the stores do it to which I said that is horrible she then apologized and I said it's not me you need to apologize to and said forget my order others are saying things like Haley Bieber being and humiliated by the public thanks to Selena Gomez watch these Hypocrites regret it if something bad psychologically happens to Haley because of this it's not lost on me that Brands and companies and products predominantly targeted at Women's insecurities have taken a malicious angle for these marketing campaigns aimed at sewing division between women facetune makeup companies Victoria's Secret we see you anyway guys it's crazy that companies and brands are driving into this drama I want to know what you guys think about this and all this Outreach that's actually made its way out in public what's your overall take on this I definitely want to know your thoughts in the comments down below I love you guys so much and as always I'll see you all in the next video [Music] thank you [Music]  
03/28/2023,These Brands Should Stop Dragging Hailey Bieber,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5JQOYmQh2g,133-21,you know this drama between Haley and Selena was all fun and games at first but now things are getting hella weird on the internet since not only are big corporations involving themselves and siding with Selena in this situation but they're also dragging Haley just for the sake of promoting their products who even invited them y'all other than this you guys there are a ton of rumors going around about Haley allegedly being pregnant and Justin Bieber leaving her at the Oscars to hide from the embarrassment between his wife and his ex Selena make sure to stay tuned for more but for now let's address what recently went down it's been a crazy three weeks on the internet with the drama that went down between Selena Haley and the Jenners in fact the more people keep bringing stuff up about Haley just to cancel her the more the drama gets worse and worse now we've seen recently how Selena got dragged by millions of people on Twitter after she decided to encourage her fans to be nice and while this situation painted her in a really bad light considering the fact she's been allowing her fan base to attack Kylie Haley and Kendall for weeks now to make this even worse Haley's friends also went on the internet last week to express their hatred towards Selena after how things went down and of course they ended up getting attacked by Selena's fans who forced them to delete their comments immediately it was clear to people at this point that many influencers and celebs were using the drama between Haley and Selena just to gain Fame and attention and that they had no pure intention in the first place to defend whoever was involved in it although no one was prepared to see big companies involving themselves in this drama just to gain customers since not only did they drag Hayley for coming after Selena last week but they even sided with Selena just to seem relatable to viewers yeah guys just imagine how messy this drama actually is that big corporations are using it to promote their products because just recently the application Duolingo got dragged for mocking Haley and their newest Tick Tock video check this out the streaming service Hulu also commented on duolingo's Tick Tock by saying this what language is this and how can we start speaking it to make this situation even worse you guys the popular Photoshop app facetune also used this picture of Haley and Selena to promote themselves and y'all even BuzzFeed mocked Haley Bieber on their website by calling her a mean girl the funny part about this you guys is that not only were companies dragging Haley to promote their products but even employees who worked at the popular shops and fast food restaurants used the drama to gain tips from customers how insane I mean look at these pictures of Starbucks and Dutch Bros employees using Selena and Haley's drama as a tipping scheme to be honest this might have been a genius idea although I can't really say the same for these Victoria's Secret employee who posted a tick tock video of themselves ripping pictures of Haley Bieber the true oh [Music] um watch these employees get fired three days from now unfortunately you guys the clout chasing continued to get worse and worse after fast food restaurants chains Sonic and Whataburger claimed to be team Selena on social media and y'all even the orange juice company SunnyD went on Twitter to announce their team Selena too personally I just feel like it's so ugly and tacky for these companies to join in and engage in the hate train towards Haley because I don't think it's funny to bash women on the internet for the sake of attention especially during women's history month anyways speaking of Haley she recently got accused of being pregnant by a random person on Tick Tock after they went and claimed that she saw Haley and Justin Bieber in the Bahamas celebrating their pregnancy you code it here first I have proof I can't share it yet Haley and Justin Bieber are aniyat in Bakers Bay and the Bahamas celebrating their pregnancy after this video went viral Haley went immediately on Instagram to debunk the rumors by telling her fans in a group chat that she's pretty much not pregnant people are saying that this could have been a PR stunt that Haley and Justin's team made to drive attention away from them and the reason why they believed this is because the couple recently went to the Oscars to celebrate with their friends and of course Justin was nowhere to be found yeah you guys a week ago Justin and Haley were rumored to show up at the Oscars ceremony after their stylist posted this picture that included their names however it turned out that Justin and Haley were attending the Oscars after party instead of the actual ceremony after Kylie Kendall Gigi and Haley made an appearance at the Oscars after party red carpet to show off their outfits at first people were confused as to why Haley showed up alone on the red carpet instead of being with her husband but then a picture of Justin was posted on social media where he appeared to be inside the venue already waiting for Haley many people found this very wrong and immature for Justin to do especially when he received a lot of hate for not defending his wife regarding the drama with Selena and just him skipping the red carpet made tons of people wonder whether he truly loves his wife or not to be honest I understand people's point of view in this case because Justin did seem to avoid everything that includes his wife in public and we recently saw how he didn't like or comment on the birthday post that Haley made for him other than this we also saw how Justin remained silent throughout the drama between Haley and Selena knowing that he could end the entire Feud at any moment but in this case Justin seems to be putting himself first and trying to avoid every negative energy being thrown at him I mean if that was me I would have done the same too because I bet he knows that there's no Escape once he addresses any topic that mentions Haley or Selena on social media anyways aside from the drama that went down at the Oscars this week let's talk about people accusing Haley of copying Selena in my previous video we talked about how Haley got accused of mocking Selena's skincare routine on Tick Tock after many fans compared the two videos together and noticed something very shady we also saw how fans accused Haley of copying Selena in her interviews as well after they pointed out how Haley's words seemed very similar to Selena's past interviews about herself and her mental health somebody asked me a while ago what's the one thing you wish people knew about you and I said I wanted it to be in my heart always had this constant battle where I was saying I wish people just knew my heart now just recently Haley got accused again of copying Selena after she decided to post a picture of her baby self on her Instagram stories and immediately people noticed that Selena had already posted a picture of her young self a couple of days earlier at first people attacked Haley for still being shady towards Selena by copying her but then things turned out to be quite the opposite after people found out that Selena might have copied Haley after she posted a childhood picture of her before Selena this situation made a lot of fans upset to the point where a Twitter user decided to accuse Haley again of copying Selena's pose by saying this oh but let me guess this is just another coincidence right not an hour after this tweet was made you guys people immediately went on social media to prove the Twitter user Wrong by posting actual evidence of Haley doing the pose way before Selena and of course this forced the Twitter user to delete their tweet following the embarrassment they received from it just take a look at what people had to say if I told you Haley did this earlier than Selena you would flip really gonna need y'all to stop being brave Haley hits this pose routinely let me guess you need a job Haley copying Selena is a never-ending thing I would love to hear your opinions on this situation down below so don't forget to click on the top above for more juicy videos on these celebs 
03/14/2023,Khloe Kardashian Gets Called Out,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNZwYFEC5TE,123-12,Khloe Kardashian has found herself once again getting laughed at by the internet because of Tristan Thompson after all that has happened between the two of them and all that has come out about Tristan and the things he's put Chloe through people truly cannot seem to understand why Chloe would be nice to him let alone dedicate a whole Instagram post to him on his birthday this is that Instagram post that she decided to do saying happy birthday Tristan you were truly the best father brother and Uncle Your Love attention silly dances hugs carpool rides bedtime rituals the way you show up for them all of the above means more than you'll ever know to your family of Littles my birthday wish for you is that you continue to Crave change healing and transformation be strong be kind be patient be free continue to make your soul and your mommy proud happy birthday baby daddy and the comments were turned off on the post so she clearly knew the reaction that she probably would have gotten in the comments section had she she had them on but that didn't mean there weren't things people said about it I didn't even know about the Instagram post until he saw her name trending on Twitter because it literally caused that big of a reaction for people that her name was trending and she actually posted the exact same message on Snapchat as well so she wasn't shying away from people seeing this that's for sure and when I tell you guys people were ripping her apart for this birthday message online they were ripping her apart people said Chloe is the poster child for poor decision making I just know Chloe better not be back with Tristan imma just act like I didn't see Khloe Kardashian's recent Instagram post is Khloe Kardashian okay a whole post and Snapchat story dedicated to the guy who cheated and embarrassed her multiple times quote best father uncle and brother LMAO you just doing it to yourself now Chloe please I'm a clown too but we have to maintain some sort of dignity here all Chloe had to do was post happy birthday Tristan and save all that crap for his birthday card because he would have bought that BS not us girl please some people were trying to defend her and said that it is possible that he can be an amazing dad but an awful partner but those people were quickly reminded that Tristan has completely ignored one of his children at least that's what the public is under the impression of because Tristan might be looking really good in these pictures with his kids but there's a whole other child missing from this photo dump that she decided to pose for his birthday and that is his child with Marley Nichols and just to paint a little timeline in case we all forgot about Marley Nichols what happened with them their son that they have together because this is the reason why people are really upset with Chloe's post because she's calling him a great dad and everyone is like I don't know about that so basically back in March of 2021 Chloe threw Tristan a birthday party and people were convinced that the two of them had either gotten back together or they were like about to get back together because she was posting photos of their little family she obviously threw him this party so they were on good terms they had definitely turned a corner from the Jordan situation and him being with other girls while she was pregnant and we're getting along but sadly this very night the night of his birthday after Chloe threw this whole birthday for him he ended up sleeping with a different woman and ended up conceiving a child with her according to the court records Tristan found out about this in June of 2021 she claimed that she was pregnant with his child and at first he denied everything and court documents also revealed him telling her through text messages that he would not be involved at all and that this was not going to be an easy way for her to get money and all of this but later he did confirm to actually sleeping with her on his 30th birthday and had a paternity test done confirming this was really his son the most wild part about all of this is that news about this did not come out publicly until months later in December of 2021 so they were going to court they were arguing about this but this did not hit the headlines until December and that's when Chloe found out about all this the same day that that the public found out about all this that's when she found out about it and she was super upset they did a whole episode of the Kardashians about it her and her sisters just couldn't believe that he didn't have the decency to even warn her about this despite the fact that he was literally dealing with the court over this for months like he just let her find out through the media and while all this was going on she claimed that he was telling her he wanted to have another baby with her like I just cannot process that at all but the timing was not on her side really with this one because before she could even find out about him having a baby with another woman her and Tristan had already hired a surrogate and transferred an embryo so they as well had a baby on the way Tristan ended up posting on Instagram after this claiming that he was going to take responsibility for his new child and also publicly apologized to Chloe saying today paternity test results reveal that I fathered a child with Marley Nichols I take full responsibility for my actions now the paternity has been estab publish I look forward to amicably raising our son I sincerely apologize to everyone I've heard or disappointed throughout this ordeal both publicly and privately Chloe you don't deserve this you don't deserve the heartache and humiliation I have caused you you don't deserve the way I have treated you over the years my actions certainly have not lined up with the way I view you I have the utmost respect and love for you regardless of what you may think again I'm so incredibly sorry I mean I don't even know how you could say he has respect for her given all that I just told you guys but what I will say is it's pretty unclear if Tristan has ever actually met his son with Marley Nichols reports claim that he has not made any attempts to see him but like I said I can't tell if it's a hundred percent or not that's just what the media is reporting what I will say is that he hasn't shared anything about him on social media or anything like that and she keeps him pretty private and not showing the baby's face but cheers Milestones like him walking celebrating holidays and has not posted him ever meeting Tristan so after all of this to see Chloe talking about him being good dad and all that people are not having it and are really really judging her right now and another reason why people were judging her is because they had also originally thought that when she posted this photo of Tristan to say happy birthday with the three kids the baby in the photo was not her son with Tristan people thought that that was his son with Marley Nichols because the baby's face was not blurred out and in all the other photos of her interest in Sun she had the baby's face blurred out and so people that thought that were like Chloe how could you even post this you look like a fool he's holding his son that he literally had behind your back why are you even giving him the time of day right now but there's just no way that that is not her baby with Tristan because Marley does not show her baby's face at all and I just don't think the first time we're gonna see that baby's face is going to be on Chloe's Instagram of all places that just feels disrespectful and weird and I just don't think that's the case I really do think that that's her baby with Tristan I don't know why the baby's face is blurred out of the other photos then but anyway you know the Kardashians do what they want I have noticed that people have been kind of calling out the Kardashians for the way that they are more protective of their sons than they are of their daughters giving Chloe and Kylie as examples as they both post their daughters a ton but are very private about the baby boys that they just had and even now Chloe is still not cheering him really and there's nothing wrong with that but people find it interesting because they just didn't do that with their other kids and they currently don't do that with their other kids but I don't know you guys this post was all over the place because I'm blurred and then it's blurred and I don't know people are just confused by this whole thing some are also wondering if Chloe and Tristan are more than just co-parenting right now because the two of them were in attendance at her best friend's birthday party over the weekend she was spotted arriving there with him and people were just like I don't know like it just seemed unnecessary for him to go unless they were together so it seems like a possibility and honestly I wouldn't be surprised they've been on and off for so many years despite all that has happened and even though people have had so much to say to her it just doesn't seem to affect her decision on Tristan and how she feels about him and like I said people have a lot to tell her I would love to know why I I really want to understand I I'm trying my hardest to like understand like intellectually make it make sense to me someone explain it to me like I'm three why is this happening I'm trying to understand why we have to be involved like could this been like a text message why are we involved Khloe Kardashian has got to stop playing in our faces she posted this tweet to Tristan Thompson calling him the best father I'm sorry but last time I checked a good father takes care of all of his children not just the ones he has with the Kardashian and I really can't stand a woman who acts like it's all good and dandy as long as the man is taking care of her kids completely disregarding the other kids he may have she continues to embarrass herself by refusing to let go of this man who clearly wants to go back to the streets but anyways shout outs to Tristan's other son who he refuses to acknowledge a man is not a good father just because he takes care of some of his kids some good points were definitely made some good points are definitely made especially the one about this kind of medituck sausage probably it probably could have been a text message and best of all it probably could have saved her being in some drama and people calling her out all I'm gonna say is that if they are back together hopefully he's learned his lessons from all the past and things are smooth going forward I don't really know if they will be but I'm hoping I'm hoping for Chloe's sake and the kids and I also hope that he is on the side seeing his other son and we just as the public do not know of that anyway that's what has Chloe in the headlines this week people once again feeling some type of way about her and how she is with Tristan let me know what you guys think about this whole mess and what people have had to say to her I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys
03/08/2023,Hailey Bieber SITUATION Gets Worse?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfO1bEBbTG4,113-21,just when we thought this entire drama ended Haley Bieber goes back again to throw shade at Selena for no reason and y'all even the Jenners exposed themselves for plotting on Selena for years you guys should all be interesting it has been a very chaotic week for both Selena and Haley and the fact that people are still pressuring both of them to bully each other on social media is crazy consider fact that Haley has been trending for days with millions of people trying to cancel her so without further Ado guys let's just jump right in and address what happened this week in my previous video on Selena and Haley we saw how Selena tried to defend her best friend Taylor Swift after a video of Haley Bieber shading her on television went viral the one-on-one rap battle full of the meanest lyrics about a celebrity sister decided to take from social media as a way to end the drama before it went too far and yeah I'm gonna be taking a second from social media because it's this is a little silly but Selena to turn three days after deactivating her Tick Tock account and this time you guys she actually commented on a video defending Haley after a tick tocker went in a dress how people are throwing unnecessary hate at both of them without actually knowing the truth these two people don't know that 95 of you guys exist they don't even know that you're breathing right now in the meantime you guys Haley was still receiving tons of hate from Selena's fans under her Instagram posts and as a way to avoid all of that she decided to limit her comment section just to protect her piece although she did unlimit her comment section A few days later to celebrate Justin's birthday and while thousands of people took this opportunity to bully both of them again after her birthday post received over 100k hate comments is it just me who didn't know her before Bieber OMG forgot to unfollow thanks you reminded me girl be for real anyways here's where the drama gets messy again because as people hoped that Haley would mind her business moving forward following the drama she unintentionally stabbed her up again after she reposted an Instagram story from a page that used the song calm down instead of the version that Selena Gomez featured on at first people thought it was very shady for Haley to do such a thing especially after how Selena defended her from her fans but thankfully she turned out later on to be innocent after the person who tagged her used the solo version of the song and the song automatically attached to her repost of the story so it was obvious that people were reaching with this one but still many fans still supported Selena's version of the song calm down after it entered the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 at number 19. yeah Selena's fans are not playing at all now let's switch the topic a little bit and talk about the recent drama that went down because as you all know people are still throwing tons of hate and accusations at both Haley and the Jenners for coming after Selena and as a result of that a lot of fans are now digging up old information and drama that no one paid attention to years ago just to cancel the girls it all started when a tick tocker posted a video about how Haley Bieber's friend friends AKA Kendall Jenner Gigi Hadid and more allegedly took Selena Gomez on a trip to Dubai for New Year's Eve years ago just so Haley could spend some time with Justin Bieber alone after this video gained a lot of attention on social media the original creator of The Tick Tock video noticed that Kylie Jenner herself added that video to her favorites months ago and while she decided to make another video exposing Kylie following all the drama that unfolded between her and Selena recently over there to the right is a video I made in October about like four months ago and I remember Kylie Jenner has saved it and I told my best friend about it but I never posted about it and now I kind of want to with everything that's going on um I don't know if anything is true or not but I'm just gonna put this out here for everyone to see and this screenshot is where I show my best friend that Kylie Jenner saved my video I also want to add that I did screen record the video of clicking her profile but I can't find it anywhere and I delete pictures so much from my camera roll I wish I still had it but it was super old the worst part about this you guys is that people are connecting the old story of Haley's friends taking Selena on a trip to Dubai to a recent video of Kendall Jenner where she was caught talking about how she had the worst experience in Dubai years ago I'm doing some stalking and my lip reading's been really good is this your first the second time this is my third my first few times were horrible horrible this is so fun yeah it's still unknown whether Kendall Jenner was mentioning that time she took Selena with her to Dubai and how she had a horrible experience but still people are trying to connect the dots to understand the hatred Kendall has towards Selena I don't know you guys this could be a reach but personally I feel like this entire feud between the Jenners and Selena is a hoax considering the fact that Selena's younger sister is very close to Kim Kardashian's daughter Northwest and they recently visited each other and posted multiple Tick Tock videos cooking food together the Kardash Jenners are managed by Kris Jenner herself and their mom knows exactly how to protect the fan family and keep them away from any drama and backlash but the main question is why are Kylie's old friends siding with Selena Gomez all of a sudden yeah if we pretend that this entire drama between Selena and Kylie was fake then why did Jordan Woods AKA Kylie's former best friend decide to post a video of herself praising Selena Gomez's rare beauty products just take a look at this foreign but the thing is you guys that Jordan wasn't the only ex-friend who threw shade at Kylie recently in fact Pia Mia who also used to be very close with Kylie decided to post a get ready with me video using Selena's beauty products and her version of the song calm down the reason why many people also believe that Pia was shading Kylie is because of a tick tock video she posted two months ago where she appeared to be shading her ex-friend Kylie after she expressed her feelings about friendships in Hollywood and even if you're friends with someone for years and you actually think that friendship is real like the second that they think you're not hot enough famous enough make enough money or whatever it is if kind of just like cut from the group without anyone telling you anything and without you doing anything wrong yeah I don't want to put too much focus on Kylie in this video but you can't deny the fact that something shady is going to calling her ex-friend suddenly switched to support Selena after witnessing the entire drama tells us pretty much everything about Kylie as a person but either way our main focus here is Haley and Justin Bieber because not only are their fans trying their best to support and defend them but even Justin's mom is going on Twitter to encourage people to stop this entire War Hate is ugly don't be ugly I'm not sure what she did right there but I think she should stay away from this entire mess especially when her son has been silent about the drama since the beginning you know it's crazy that Justin hasn't spoken about the issue yet considering the fact that many celebrities involve themselves and unfollowed Haley to support Selena and to make it even worse Haley has also been trending for days on Twitter with millions of people making memes about her that gained more than 100K likes they started comparing Haley to Putin for some reason saying young Vladimir Putin looks like Haley Bieber someone also shared an embarrassing video of Haley getting pushed by a Paparazzi so Kylie could get photographed remember when Haley Bieber thoughts the paparazzis were expecting her and she acted all snobbish but then they were actually waiting for Kylie Jenner this will always be funny to me great guys come on guys thank you Haley Bieber has some nerve Throwing Shade knowing Selena could end her marriage with him I miss us text Haley Bieber and Kylie Jenner losing followers left and right I'm not saying she deserved it I'm saying God's timing is always right speaking of Kylie and Haley losing followers well throughout this entire drama you guys Selena has gained over 12 million followers in a week while both Haley and Kylie lost 1 million followers and well according to Insight Selena is on track to become the first woman to ever reach 400 million followers foreign 
03/06/2023,Haiyley Bieber Drama Gets Worse...,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0Wm08ZBTnM,108-21,more people are getting dragged into this Haley Justin and Selena drama and the comments are only getting nastier like really nasty Madison Beer has found herself in the conversation somehow as people have been digging through Haley's past people have been trying to find times Haley has copied Selena shaded her and so much more going back years and years for some of this stuff but how Madison got involved in all of this is because there's been talks of drama from when Selena launched her brand rare Beauty back in 2020 and it's coming back to haunt Madison that she ever hung out with Haley that same night basically when Selena had her big celebration in order to celebrate this launch it was at a popular La restaurant called Craig's Haley and Madison ended up showing up to the same restaurant that night and got Paparazzi and they got a lot of hate when people saw the photos people were feeling like they were trying to ruin Selena's night and this had to be some sort sort of setup plan Selena fans were even more upset with Madison than Haley at the time since she was actually close friends with Selena so everyone was commenting on her Instagram with the snake emoji and the hate was insane people were even claiming that Selena unfollowed Madison at the time even though that wasn't actually true and Selena was still following Madison all throughout this drama but the hate got so bad that Madison ended up commenting on the situation and replied to a Selena fan saying these rumors are getting insane I had dinner with my friend Haley of 10 years that's literally it I love Selena as you all know and I would never do anything to directly upset her and if this did how can you call me a horrible person please relax it's just mean and unnecessary and nothing happened it was simply a coincidence Madison's response didn't cool things down for her at all and she ended up getting even more hate which led to Selena coming to her defense and commenting on Instagram this is disgusting reading all of this this wasn't in functional whatsoever I'm so disappointed that people would speak to someone like this I've known Madison since she was a baby and watched her continue to become the woman she is there is no issue a year after all of this restaurant drama celebrity gossip Instagram page dumwa added more fuel to this drama even though it was pretty much moved past by this time but Zuma posted information from anonymous source talking about a particular celebrity stylist saying this well-known stylist will often run her mouth off about one of her famous clients all the time stylist feels she should get more credit for clients off-duty street style basically saying things like I invented her and she wouldn't be the style icon she is without me someone replied to this and said this stylist if I'm guessing correctly also tries to be best friends with said client she once befriended a girl who was close with a famous ex-girlfriend of her client's husband got inside information about a party the ex was having at Craig's then dressed our client into the nines called paps to show up and have her client fully upstage the exes celebration the ex was devastated and so was the girl that was duped by the stylist for info so basically people were interpreting this as Haley's stylist got information from another one of her clients who was a friend of Selena's and gave the info to Haley and they purposely tried to ruin Selena's night now let me just say that this is all speculation not 100 like confirmed or anything like that but that is what people are believing and interpreting out of these posts from duois now like I said this was posted in 2021 and this didn't happen in 2020 and literally we are now in 2023 and this celebratory dinner at Craig's is getting brought up again and so is this post from dumois even though Selena claimed to be unbothered by them showing up at the same restaurant and clearly wasn't standing for hate and Madison claimed it was a total coincidence that the two of them are at the same restaurant as Selena people are now taking this as just like another time that Haley he was being obsessive with Selena and also just being a mean girl trying to ruin her night and because of all of this is getting talked about again Madison is getting hate all over again and the comments are nasty you guys like literally so horrible Madison announced recently that her dog had been diagnosed with cancer and her dog ended up passing away recently and people have been commenting very nasty and hurtful things about her dog and this being her karma like horrible things no matter what side people want to be on in all of this I feel like that's just like way too far like Madison doesn't evenly directly involved in this situation we're talking about something from 2020 and Selena literally follows Madison so they clearly don't have any beef but plenty of people are commenting on Madison's Instagram and on her Tick Tock calling her a mean girl saying things like she's a bully saying side eye and Madison did speak up about this current heat she's receiving and I can't tell if this comment was deleted or it got very because there's so many comments under her last Tick Tock but this is what she had to say in response to the hate hello to everyone coming to attack me Selena cleared all of this up herself when it happened under my Instagram post it is not true please stop saying like oh this is why your dog died that is evil and what you think happened did not you can look up where she cleared it up and a fan of hers ended up tweeting at her saying at Madison Beer I'm so sorry for all the disgusting comments you're getting right now on Tick Tock you never deserve the hate we truly care about you we know your heart please do not listen to all those people we love you and she addressed the comments once again like quotes reading this saying people saying my puppy dying was Karma over something that never even happened and that Selena even cleared up herself it's just unbelievable now in all of this you would probably be wondering what has been said about Justin but honestly he hasn't been facing any real backlash for being at the center of this instead people are actually trying to save him and his comment section has gotten Wild let me tell you with people using the hashtag free Justin commenting free Justin people also bringing Britney Spears into the conversation with several people referencing the fact that she wasn't free to do what she wanted for so long and commenting under Justin's posts saying we got Brittany free weekend for you too someone else even said Justin we saved Britney we can save you too people are trying to tell him to even signal for help Justin wear a shirt if you're held hostage and telling him to get a divorce just straight up saying as Adele said divorce babe divorce divorce her and be free from all the drama hey Justin wear a pink shirt on your next post if you're thinking about divorce I mean you guys it's wild out here I was telling you it's crazy the whole thing is just getting crazier and crazier and more and more people are starting to get dragged into the drama every day and it makes me wonder if Justin or Haley will actually come out to address things because it doesn't really seem like the conversation is dying down anytime soon with the way people keep digging through the past now in regards to some of the narratives out there about Haley being obsessed with Justin and Selena or stealing Justin from Selena or he's still in love with Selena I will say I do have a theory about what kind of happened between the three of them and how it ended up with Justin being married to Haley and this is just my theory based upon 2018. the time period in which Justin and Selena were hanging out again and then two months later he ended up with Haley so this is my little theory if you don't want to hear a theories or opinions don't watch it I put it at the end of the video for a reason basically I made this as a tick tock talking about this and I kind of want to know what you guys think and if this is really like the case of what happened I feel for Selena so hard but here's my theory I do not think that Haley lied when she went on call her daddy and she said that when Justin and Selena got together in 2018 they had to close the chat chapter on them that was a situation where I I know for a fact that it was the right thing for them to close that door I know for a fact that the reason we were able to get back together was because it was very much completely closed and I think that is very true for Justin I was listening to Selena's song that came out in 2018 back to you and I know she's just one of many writers on this song so everything just take it with a grain of salt but this is what I'm choosing to believe in the song she's saying and what's the point of hiding everybody knows we've got unfinished business I think this was because her and Dustin were extremely public when they got back together back in 2018 when they were hanging out they were kissing in public like all of this stuff and towards the end of the song she says I know I say I wasn't sure which makes me kind of go to this theory that I didn't really believe in before that was like Justin probably proposed to Selena and she said no and that's why he's with Haley now I don't really think maybe he proposed but I do think that he was heavily like I want to settle down I want to get married and she wanted to maybe work out some of the issues that they had and kind of resolve those before they were to make like a huge step like marriage back in 2018 she clearly loved him loved that time that they were spending together she wrote lose you to love me literally is so heartbroken saying in two months you were placed us like she was shocked that in two months he was literally getting engaged so I don't think that Haley stole him or like manipulated him into being with her I think she was just there ready to marry him when he was looking for that and Selena was like no I want to work on us first before we do that he was like no I mean in the same song She's literally saying we never got it right playing and we're playing old conversations overthinking every word and I hate it because it's not me like it sounds toxic and I think she wanted to fix that before committing to something but he wasn't down and that is my theory no I do not think I'm like 100 correct this is just my thoughts and feelings like if that whole story is true I'm literally like for Selena that type of heartbreak is just horrible and she deserves better she deserves better but like I said I want to know what you guys think about all of this in the comments below so let me know I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys [Music] beautiful [Music] 
03/03/2023,Kylie Jenner BULLIES Selena Gomez For Passing Her In Followers??,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCVUw921K2w,105-17,it hasn't been a day since we talked about how Kendall Jenner recently threw shade at Selena Gomez and now her sister Kylie is joining the mean girl club and trying to put Selena down yeah this family needs some humbling ASAP the fact that it hasn't been a week since Haley and Kendall came after Selena and now Kylie is trying to step in and throw shade of Selena out of jealousy is something that needs to be studied I'm not saying she deserved it but I'm saying God's timing is always right and luckily for us we've gathered a lot of info about the situation and let me tell you this not looking good for Kylie at all so without further Ado guys let's just jump right in just when we thought Kendall Jenner learned her lesson about being shady to A-list celebrities her sister Kylie decided to join in this week and come after Selena Gomez for numerous reasons and the main one being jealousy and followers as we all know both Kylie Jenner and Selena Gomez are in the same industry aside from Selena doing both modeling and singing she's also a businesswoman just like Kylie and we all know that they both own one of the biggest makeup brands on the market and that is Kylie cosmetics and rare Beauty now the question is is it possible for Selena and Kylie to be enemies considering the fact that they are both in the same field it is possible for them to dislike each other since it gets quite competitive in the beauty industry when it comes to selling makeup and products for their fans although the situation in today's video is far different from them just competing over makeup because one of the girls recently got butt hurt over the other person surpassing her in followers and things went completely out of hand between them as you all know both Kylie and Selena have been battling each other on Instagram for followers for a while and a year ago one of them gets crowned for being the most followed female artist on Instagram as they keep surpassing each other with a couple million followers now just recently some reports started going around that Selena might have surpassed Kylie again in followers after it got revealed that Selena was gaining millions of followers a week and as a result of this both Selena and Kylie began battling each other over with followers after they started posting Instagram pictures at the same time just to play with the algorithm and gain a few followers eventually Selena surpassed kylian followers in only 24 hours after she gained more than 500k followers while Kylie lost 75k due to people supporting Selena over her sister Kendall and you guys this is where the entire drama began after Kylie and Haley Bieber decided to go on their Instagram Stories the next day to make fun of Selena's laminated brows yeah guys this all started when Selena posted an Instagram story saying how she laminated her eyebrows way too much and shortly after that Kylie posted a picture on her Instagram story mocking Selena saying this was an accident after this Kylie proceeded to post a FaceTime screenshot between her and Haley Bieber on her stories and in the screenshot Kylie and Haley seem to be showing their eyebrows as a way to mock Selena now as you know both Haley and Selena recently got involved in a huge drama together after people decided to accuse Haley of shading Selena in a tick tock video with Kendall I'm not saying she deserved it but I'm seeing God's timing is always right and of course the situation escalated immediately with both Selena and Haley responding to the accusations while Kendall the other hand escape the drama with zero response now when it comes to Kylie's Shady Instagram story people thought that she was intentionally tagging Haley just to be shady towards Selena for surpassing her followers and the worst part about this you guys is that Haley even got encouraged by Kylie to throw more shade at Selena after she posted one of the songs Selena used on her Tick Tock stories at this point I can't even say it was a coincidence as expected the internet handled this situation terribly after people went on Kylie's Instagram page and started spamming a bunch of hate comments telling her that Selena is better and that her blush sold more than her entire makeup collection and as a result Kylie decided to limit the comment section just to avoid any hate from Selena's fanbase here's what people had to say Kylie do you really want to start a feud with Selena you can never have enough Talent it's giving desperate lol at me thinking Kylie is above this silly childish ax I'm not even a Selena fan but this is unacceptable used to like Kylie but after the recent mean girl Behavior she's becoming one of my least fave you can tell that a lot of fans were upset with how Kylie turned out to be from the amount of likes on these comments although I do have to say that many people came to her defense as well and said that Kylie has been posting a lot of pictures of her eyes and eyebrows lately to tease new products and this product could either be mascara or an eyebrow gel let's just sit and hope that this rumor is true but based on people's reactions I can't tell you that it's only getting worse because why are people now accusing Kylie of calling Selena boring in her newest Tick Tock video you said that I'm really [ __ ] boring well that's rich coming from you y'all are literally dragging at this point anyways this situation ended thankfully with Kylie responding to all these accusations and while she pretty much went off on people for reaching and trying to create unnecessary beef between each other here's what she said this is reaching no shade towards Selena ever and I didn't see her eyebrow posts you guys are making something out of nothing this is silly as soon as Kylie made this comment Selena then went and replied to Kylie by defending her as well and admitting that she's a big fan of hers agreed Kylie Jenner it's all unnecessary I'm a fan of Kylie you tell that Selena was pretty aware of all the [ __ ] these models were throwing at her and based on her comment I don't think she truly cared about Kylie receiving hate because we all know that her Instagram story with Haley Bieber was intentional now as much as people wanted this drama to end between Kylie Haley and Selena unfortunately Taylor Swift got involved in the scene somehow after Selena felt brave enough to drag Haley Bieber again for shading Taylor years ago on live television and y'all just take a look at the video that Selena responded to the one-on-one rap battle full of the meanest lyrics about a celebrity says Taylor Swift's last album and here's the comment that Selena laughed so sorry my best friend is and continues to be one of the best in the game honestly I understand that Selena is finally standing up for herself now and defending her friends but I think this was very unnecessary for her to give more attention to Haley considering the fact that she's getting blamed by the whole media for starting this drama but at the same time we all know that Haley was the reason behind this mess especially after she made that video of her and Kendall mocking Selena from getting body shamed by the entire internet anyways Selena ended the drama by going on Tick Tock live hours later to address the situation and well she revealed that she will be taking a long break from social media and that she's too old to be doing all of this well I'd have to care if there was and yeah I'm gonna be taking a second from social media because it's this is a little silly and I'm 30 I'm too old for this so and I will you guys um sooner than later I just I'm gonna just take a break from everything now a couple of minutes both activated her Tick Tock account and vanished from the internet she actually left another comment on a new tick tock video and well let's just say that her comment was shady AF since not only did she support people hating on Haley but she also stood up for Taylor Swift Again by saying that she has every right to defend her friends take a look at this it got worse but I feel like it's about to get worse off it got worse though it got worse though it got worse though and it's gonna get worser crazy I'm getting off social media I have every right to defend my friends say whatever you want about me but my people I die for thanks so much as soon as this comment started circulating on the internet a lot of people went to Twitter to drag Selena for trying so hard to gain Haley's attention and y'all they even attacked her for dragging the drama for too long when she promised her fans to log out of social media here's what people had to say who is she fighting with because it's just her she's fighting demons she wants Haley's attention very bad OMG like literally the most passive aggressive and Petty celeb ever log off already you said you would oh brother she's too old for this like put that phone down now I would like to hear your opinion on this entire drama down below also don't forget to click on the tab to catch up on more news about these celebs
02/18/2023,Hailey Bieber Is In Trouble But It’s Weird....,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oZyAgwg-8o,103-20,there's been a lot of hate coming towards both Haley Bieber and Selena Gomez and people have come up with a lot of theories to try to connect their situations together and it's only made things Messier so to break things down last month Selena Gomez posted a few photos from her New Year's trip where she was in a bikini she was on a boat with her friends having the time of her life and of course some horrible people on the internet decided to ruin that fun for her and comment some really nasty things body shaming her it was horrible around the same time that all that was going on people noticed that Haley Bieber had posted a tick tock onto her account and then she quickly deleted it and The Tick Tock was her Kendall Jenner and Justine Skye and in the video they're lip syncing to the audio and I'm not saying she deserved it but I'm saying God's timing is always right people were getting major mean girl vibes from this and a ton of speculation started happening that this was them somehow shading Selena getting a lot of hate which I feel like this is a stretch personally I feel like it wasn't connected if it was that's super bad I don't know why they would do that but I really don't feel like it was connected there's actually like no proof that this is about Selena at all which is why I find the whole drama really out of control but people ran with this idea that Haley just had to be shading her now The Tick Tock was deleted like I said it wasn't even up for very long but a lot of those who saw it re-uploaded it and a lot of people were talking about it and in one of the re-uploaded videos someone posted they said the theories that were going around about how Haley was shading Selena and Haley commented on this video she said I never comment on this type of thing but we were just having a girls night and did a random Tick Tock sound for fun it's not directed at anyone although she denied it people commented it under the same post saying this sound hasn't trended since like last year deaf intentional no one uses this sound without reason they are the Mean Girls nothing they do is innocent if they deleted it there was guilt there people also had noted that this wasn't a good look for the other girls in the video and Kendall recently opened up on this last season of the Kardashians about the fact that people think that she's a mean girl she was asked by the producer what are some of the misconceptions that you've heard about yourself and she said just so people think she's mean and she doesn't like that and she felt like people have always questioned her character and if they only knew her things would be different and they would have different things to say about her and she just felt like she gets hate no matter what she does and people have these preconceived ideas about her and her sisters and that's just like really hard to change so this certainly wasn't helping win over the haters with the way that they felt like this Tick Tock was giving all the Mean Girl Vibes now I will say on a whole other note that there was also some speculation that the reason why Haley might have taken this down so quickly was because this was around the same time when news came out of Tristan Thompson's mom passing and Haley took it down so people would not think that this was about that and that was the real reason it was taken down and to me that makes a lot more sense that she would take it down I don't know who that Tick Tock would have been about or if you know she was being for real when she said that they just did that Tick Tock for fun but obviously her taking it down because she doesn't want it to come across like they were making that about Tristan's mom so that makes sense to me as to why she would remove that Tick Tock because that's way past mean girl that makes them look so bad if that was still up but whether or not you believe these three girls got together to shade Selena or not Selena did end up hearing about this since the video was going around and a lot of people were talking about it Selena ended up commenting on on someone's Tick Tock who was reacting to this whole thing I'm just seeing this Tick Tock I'm not saying she deserved it but I'm saying God is she for real does she really really even like a Avid follower of this situation but isn't Haley the one that like begs Selena to tell off her fans for bullying her I mean Haley's a right and she commented on the video saying it's okay I don't let these things get me down be nice to everyone and people were just like Selena this is so sad that you even had to see this and they were just feeling all sorts of bad for her and then this past week Selena ended up going live on Tick Tock to address some of the comments that she had been getting all of these body shaming comments and people having questions about her it's just honestly so sad that she even felt like this was something that she needed to talk about people really need to chill out and not comment on how people's bodies look it's just sad that this is something she felt like she needed to explain like that's just ridiculous but she did get on live and she said this tend to hold a lot of water weight and that happens very normally and then when I'm off of it I tend to to kind of lose weight really guys um I just I just wanted to say and encourage anyone out there who feels any sort of Shame for exactly what they're going through and nobody knows the real story so I just want people to know that you're beautiful and you're wonderful and yeah we have days where maybe we feel like but I would much rather be healthy and take care of myself and my medications are important and I believe and they are what helps me so yeah not a model never will be and I think they're awesome mind you I just I definitely am definitely not that so uh that's it thanks for supporting me and understanding and if not go away because honestly I I don't believe in shaming people for body or anything one thing about Tick Tock is that it will take a serious conversation into a very non-serious conversation so quickly on live with the way that you can like send people on live money and they'll put that like cowboy hat on you they'll put sunglasses on you but I know that Tick Tock is the only form of social media that she says she has on her own phone I believe her Instagram account is on her assistant's phone so I'm pretty sure that's why she decided to go live on Tick Tock and not on any other platform because that's the only one that she has access to on her own phone and the reasoning behind that is because of haters and people commenting and the fact that she was once like the number one most followed person on Instagram and that's very overwhelming so that's why she's on Tick Tock and I mean on the live she's literally like covering her face trying not to get like gift set to her and have that stuff on her face but I mean that's just how Tick Tock is what she is saying on this live though is very important it is very serious people should not be commenting on how she looks people should not be questioning how she looks it's ridiculous that people want to give commentary on all of that but she is clearly not standing for the hate she's going to let people know that it is wrong to even comment on things like that and if they don't like her they can go now Selena wasn't the only one this week that came out to talk about the struggles of being in the public eye and getting hateful comments Haley took to her YouTube channel and in a video where she was getting ready she was talking about how hard it is to kind of see a comment and how it can really sit with her in affect her mood she felt like she was kind of off and like going through a hard time and wasn't able to shake off some of the comments that she'd been seeing I don't know what's been in the air for me a little bit lately but I've definitely been feeling little bit down I think it's you know a combination of things and you know sometimes when I'm filming these videos I feel like it's a good opportunity to just be able to talk and be honest there's good days and bad days and not every day feels this way but I could read a comment that really throws me through a loop and makes me feel sad it really um affects me so deeply because it feels really loud and really intense and so yeah I definitely struggle with that I think this whole situation has really blown way out of proportion because it was all based on speculation and it kind of sucks because I honestly thought once this photo went viral last year that there wouldn't be any Selena Haley online drama or people feeling like Haley didn't like Selena or vice versa but it didn't seem to solve much hopefully these two like low-key speak to each other privately and they're on good terms and this was all just like misinterpreted by those who saw the original Tick Tock and there isn't this mean girl energy being put towards Selena by Haley and her friends because that would literally be so awful I just feel like Haley's talked about number of times how Justin's ex's fan base has come at her that she wouldn't purposely try and post something anti-selina Gomez I just feel like she would know better not to do that because people would come for her so that's what's really making me feel like this was all just not thought through how it would look but I don't know you guys that's what's been going on recently and that's what these two have come out and said I love you guys so much and I will talk to you guys in the next video bye guys [Music] thank you 
02/03/2023,How Everyone Left The Hype House & They Got Sued..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWwidpZkQ1A,96-18,who would have thought that the hype house would return with a new lawsuit against them this year despite many members and victims doing both the hype house and the owner of the hype house Thomas Petro multiple times this time you guys their landlord decided to file a lawsuit on all the members for causing more than a million dollars in Damages to his Mansion I mean seriously what did he expect from these teenage tick-tockers anyway that led to the hype house getting sued let's talk about the hype house first and the amount of lawsuits people have filed against them if you guys have seen my previous videos on the hype house then you probably know the amount of lawsuits that they've been involved in ever since it started we all know that chase Hudson Thomas petro and Daisy Keach were the ones who came up with the idea to start a house with influencers and their idea was to encourage as many huge creators as possible to join their house so that they could boost their careers and make loads of money off of their Fame unfortunately many creators fell into the hype house trap and joined the house just like the demelio sisters Addison Ray avani Luray and many more and while everything went completely perfect at first things went downhill When Stacy Keach aka the co-founder of the hype house sued both Thomas and Chase for not crediting her and giving her recognition for building the hype house even though I had someone telling me to go get some recognition because I know that I deserved I put down eighteen thousand dollars plus my own platform y'all this caused many influencers to lose their trust in Thomas in which some of them decided to leave in the early stages of the hype house this was the first time the hype house got sued but after that things went downhill for them once one of their members Tony Lopez got involved in multiple controversies and during this era everyone in the house was getting exposed left and right on social media including his brother Andreas Lopez and so many more this situation pushed a lot of victims to speak up including an underage girl who decided to sue both Thomas petro and Chase Hudson for allowing Tony Lopez to take advantage of her knowing that she was underage the first thing that Thomas did was to kick the Lopez brothers out of his house and shortly after that chase Hudson decided to quit managing the hype house which ended up leaving Thomas taking care of the house alone of course Thomas decided to upgrade the house at that time and he actually ended up moving to the the most famous mansion in LA with the rest of his members yeah in case you guys didn't know this Mansion was owned by a bunch of YouTubers and influencers and it was called the clout house back in 2017 and years after them living in that house they decided to move out and rent it to the hype house now if we're being honest the decision that Thomas made was extremely horrible since not only did the new house have one of the most chaotic neighborhoods ever but its address was also leaked all across social media which led to fans showing up at the house and asking for pictures but I guess Thomas wasn't really running away from the public attention because a lot of people assumed that the house invasion that occurred at the hype house years ago was the reason behind his decision anyways after years of the hype house constantly moving Mansions they suddenly got hit by a lawsuit by one of their landlords this week after TMZ published an article talking about how the hype house members are getting sued for ruining the property of their old house and not paying for it members of the hype house are being taken to Court by their former landlord that's claiming they caused some serious property damage to the home and now won't pay up per their agreement yeah guys they're a landlord who goes by at Danny Hollywood homes on Instagram uploaded a YouTube video talking about how he's suing the high pass members for three hundred thousand dollars worth of damage hi Daniel Fitzgerald here Danny Hollywood homes please watch the video of the hype house destroying my home in a breach of contract moved out five months early and haven't paid the rent in his YouTube video you guys Danny showed clips of the members AKA Bryce Hall Nikita Austin and Alex damaging the house by using a flamethrower throwing trash cans at each other breaking glass on the floor and even playing basketball inside the house check this out [Applause] [Music] oh my God I went downstairs although Danny has actual proof of multiple tick-tockers ruining his house he decided to sue only the ones who were in control of the hype house after he wrote this in the description of the video the hype house is going to end up in court Thomas Petro Cole Hudson Mia Hayward Calvin goldsby Patrick Huston and Nicholas Austin moved out of my Hollywood Hills property five months before their lease ended and left it in such bad condition it's crazy that not even Bryce Hall and other members were sued for damaging the property despite the fact that they uploaded videos of them pulling stunts at the house publicly but I guess Danny played it smart since he has actual proof now in the court of the members damaging his property from their YouTube videos anyways Danny ended his YouTube video with him visiting the Mansion to address the damages the members made and y'all not only did he accuse the members of ruining the house but but he also accused them of ruining the pool as well after he found damages in the water and tiles we really don't know how they did us to the pool though but the pool has like 11 motors for the jacuzzi and now only one of them is working the heater is broken the control panels are broken both of them there's some videos of them jumping off the roof here so they damage the roof you don't on a hot day you can't walk on this roof because it's a tar roof and then you ruin all the the roofing so the roofing's messed up on the roof now too then all the furniture was brand new all brand new the whole patio was brand new and all the furniture looks old and worn out now and a lot of the cushions are broken so that's our first glance right now they would have a trash can right here with trash overflowing and the trash would get stuck on this return caused the machine to freeze and it would burn up the motor so we would have to replace the motor you come in here you're going to see all the water damage and mold once again this is water damage there's mold after Danny saw how frustrated he was about the situation he went on a news show a couple of days later to address the comments after a lot of people put the blame on him for trusting these tick-tockers with his mansion and y'all this is what he had to say for it to film these damages they actually put these damages on their YouTube it says it in their lease no fireworks Allowed no pyrotechnics in the house no you know oh you don't have to pay and they can make up their own rules but you know they have to understand what they signed they signed a court document map to live up to it it's clear that Danny was upset with the hype house members and what they caused to his property because not only did he go to multiple news channels to talk about the situation but he even posted all the articles on his Instagram and responded to multiple comments saying this doing business with d-bag kids what did you expect LOL I should have known better this is a win for him honestly more publicity as well as the fact that he's gonna get money in court let's hope Justice is served ouch sorry to hear this didn't you knew they were influencers unfortunate actually that is what they do trash people's places I had too much trust what a bunch of spoiled brats with no respect for property or the law I hope the judge drives it into them Danny go for it bro they need to learn respect it's crazy how Thomas petro and the members gave zero response about the lawsuit while it was going down because tons of people were throwing hate under their comment section talking about how embarrassing it was for them to be ruining a property when they're full-grown adults and to make it even worse an attorney also went to publicly speak on the situation in a tick tock video after he obtained the lawsuit from someone and so this is the actual allegations in the complaint this is what the landlord is alleging is true and it hasn't been proven hasn't been answered so we don't know what's true but um he's alleging that they had basically uh they rented this mansion from him uh they're they're using it as a high pass as their physical location they reached the lease agreement by vacating plaintiffs plaintiff's home five months early and causing more than three hundred thousand dollars in property damage which sounds like either a real wild party or a lot of wild parties so yeah apparently the members had a settlement agreement with Danny before the lawsuit happened after they agreed to pay him 400 000 to resolve this and they started making payments of 10K a month for almost seven months until they randomly stopped one day so in conclusion they approximately paid 70k for Danny to fix the damages instead of paying the full price and this was the reason why Danny took the situation publicly to expose the hype house members since not only did they ruin his property but they also ignored the agreement and decided to pay him 70k to shut him up and fix the damages that they've caused here's what people had to say about this into higher situation phase slash clout gang rented this house before them through major parties and they didn't get sued says a lot about how bad the damages could supposedly be they rented to a bunch of kids and they trashed the house shocker LOL the landlord sells it out to Rich Kids so he can sue them a pyramid scheme TBH Thomas has a cool card collection but can't pay for this anyways loves if you enjoyed today's video then make sure to subscribe and click on the tab right above 
01/20/2023,The Kardashian Sisters Are in Trouble....,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOlFcsZtIQI,92-17,whether people want to admit it or not the Kardashian family does have influence and people do follow them believe what they say and buy their products it's how they're so rich and famous because there are so many people out there who genuinely do want to support them and it's one of the big reasons why they've been called out because they do hold influence and some people believe that they don't always send out the right message especially when it comes to being honest about having work done and I want to say this because before we get into it I know that talking about this kind of stuff is quite controversial so I definitely want to give the disclaimer that I don't give a flying Flo doodle if you get work done like do you if that's what makes you feel good then great I literally do not care if people get work done it's literally up to the individual what they want to do if they don't if they do I really don't care however a lot of people do take issue with when people get work done and then say Oh it's all natural baby and that's been a huge issue people have had with the Kardashians for years now is that they don't seem to be super honest just about what they've had done and that can lead other people especially people that they influence to feel bad about their own natural looks to go way back when Kylie originally got her lips done people had all these questions about what she did if she didn't have anything done if she was doing something natural like people wanted to know they were so curious because the only thing she was really saying was that she was overlining her lips or she was using multiple different lip colors like there wasn't any I got filler or I got an implant like there was nothing being said about that there was even a Kylie Jenner lip challenge that went around where people were trying to make their lips bigger naturally and very dangerous ways to try and get this Kylie Jenner look because she wasn't exactly being clear with how she did it and people really wanted to try it out themselves they wanted this look that she had and I do think that this is a huge reason as to why Kylie Cosmetics was such a big success when it first launched because it was all about lips she was doing lip kits and Kylie was known for her lips and people wanted their lips to look like her lips and so products flew off of the Shelf but she did eventually fast up to the fact that she did get her lips done and said that she didn't want to admit it at first out of judgment and I will say she was young at the time but now the Kardashian Jenners are all adults and they know that they have influence over others and people feel like they should be more honest about what they're having done instead of acting like it's all died in exercise and no filler no nothing all natural baby I do think that a reason why they wouldn't share is because they would get judgment either way but I do think that there are so many people that are so open about getting filler and doing all these other things that it shouldn't be such a secret but people have been very quick to judge the girls for having said that died in exercise is what got them where they are because there's been videos of them working out from their show that have gone around the internet and people are like there's no way that they're getting results with this form that they have all that stuff so there's been a lot of judgment there [Music] from Photoshop to alternative methods people want them to know how much power they hold and try to encourage others not to be put down by everything they see online because it's not always reality because there are truly a lot of people that see photos of the Kardashians and compare themselves to them and feel bad about themselves because they think that they're supposed to naturally look that way and they don't really make it clear like what they're doing behind the scenes plus let's just talk about lifestyle in general they obviously have chefs that prepare food for them and they have people that go out and buy their groceries they're not tempted by certain snacks and things and whatnot they have access to a ton of stuff that other people don't so I think it's just people should not compare themselves to the Kardashians because it's just ridiculous they're definitely living a very unrealistic lifestyle than most now recently I will say there's been a lot of speculation about what the Kardashians have been doing because there has been a rise in a lot of celebrities apparently using this diabetic medication called ozempic to lose weight and people have speculated that the Kardashians have been using it as a weight loss method and I'm only bringing this up because Chloe addressed the situation so that's the only reason why I'm talking about this whole spectacle that is ozempic right now because she did comment back to somebody who accused her of using it so recently Chloe did a photo shoot and people mistook her for Taylor Swift and felt like there was just no way that this was Chloe in these photos and I think it's just the bangs honestly I don't think she looks just like Taylor but if you find photos of Taylor and put them side by side from a certain photo shoot and a certain lighting it does look kind of similar but I think it's just the bangs anyway somebody commented on an account that had posted these photos and said the fact that she uses diabetic medicine to get this skinny is disturbing and she clapped back and actually commented saying let's not discredit my years of working out I get up five days a week at 6am to train please stop with your assumptions I guess New Year still means mean people some felt like she wasn't exactly denying the use of medication but instead wanted to also make it known that she had actively been working out all these years but a lot of other people were defending Chloe and saying that's just a ridiculous rumor that is going around about her using ozempic and who cares what she's doing she looks great so it's become a huge debate surrounding the Kardashians and whether or not they should be honest about what they're doing as well as other celebrities too like they're not the only celebrities that would keep things a secret I mean there's a ton of other people that are famous that don't say what they've got going on and people would just like it if they were honest because they want to know to feel better about themselves I think self-comparison is a true devil and and if you look at photos of these celebrities and then you look at yourself and you're like damn like I'm upset at how I look and all that stuff I mean if you don't like good for you like you do not compare yourself to others good for you but not everyone is like that it's just like one of those things and I think that's why people wish that these celebrities were so honest because then you could at least be like oh well it's because I didn't do this then you know I'm okay like I don't need to be concerned or feel bad for myself or you know anything like that I don't know that's just me being honest I do think that the conversation around this gets complicated and it is just like so personal but if they're lying and saying that it's one thing when it's another thing that I'd say is messed up and a lot of doctors actually come forward talking about this latest medical Trend I was talking about earlier and there's been a lot of rumors of shortages of this medication for actual diabetic patients due to the rise in people seeking it out for aesthetic purposes which is concerning it's concerning concerning concerning and it definitely not good at all now another thing that people have pointed out over the years is that Kylie's friends have slowly like transformed into looking like her and people are like that just means like they all go to the same doctor like that's been something that people have said and I will say that if you like showed me half of like Kylie's friends and ask me like guess if it was Kylie or one of her friends I would most definitely tell you in every single one of these photos it was her I would not even guess that this is her makeup artist Ariel like what I I literally would think that that was Kylie he's so a lot of people feel like this is very telling to the fact that they've all done a little something which I will say that Ariel has been honest about getting work done he's posted in the place that he goes to get abs at and stas has been honest about getting work done as well she has a YouTube channel and she's done Vlogs vlogging experiences getting plastic surgery yes I've gotten lip filler yes I've gotten like things done to myself so first we have all this gel on my stomach and then basically this thing heats up right it feels like a hot stone massage and it basically just heats up and tightens your skin so people have just been like well if y'all are doing it and you guys look like Kylie then that must mean but anyway Chloe is clearly saying you know she has been working out and getting up five days a week at six a.m to train so that's what's been going on I wanna say once again that if people get work done I literally don't care I think that all of these girls look amazing I think that they look bomb I thought that they looked amazing before as well I'm not judging anyone that gets work done but if people are gonna lie about it then it's definitely like uh I mean I see why people would want to keep it private and want to keep it to themselves but when you influence so many people and you're gonna be like I'm natural but you're not you're gonna make people feel bad about themselves like that's just the case and yeah I do believe that people shouldn't be responsible for other people's insecurities but this one in particular is just an interesting topic in my opinion mostly because if you're gonna lie and not be honest it just gives people the wrong idea about stuff so that's my opinion maybe it's controversial but I am open to hearing what you guys think in the comments below about this whole topic do you guys feel like the Kardashians or celebrities in general have a responsibility to be honest with their fans about things that they've done or do you think it should be something that they don't have to talk about let me know your thoughts in the comments below I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys [Music] thank you

10/07/2022,Monty Lopez Has Officially Lost It...,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9SpHFvxKmw,51-26,what is actually going on with Monty Lopez now you guys know there has been an extremely concerning pattern among celebrities and that is that their parents are always terrible obviously not every single person to ever get famous has a horrible mother or father but we consistently see a high frequency of famous people coincidentally having a problematic family member this seems to be even more common when it comes to child stars or people that become famous early on in life and sadly Addison Ray has been the newest victim of having a parent that is absolutely insane Monty Lopez is the father of Addison Ray and for the most part he was just like any other Dad out there in America that was until his daughter became famous since Addison has been starring in lead roles and serving looks at the Met Gala her dad Monty has become more and more cringe each passing day but not only are his actions extremely embarrassing for Addison but they are also probably very upsetting for her too as she would have to have all of her drama including her dad's messy Behavior broadcasted to the world so let's start with the biggest and most shocking Scandal that Monty was involved in which was when 25 year old influencer Renee Ash came out to reveal that she had been in a five month long relationship with Monty all while he was still married to Addison's mother Sherry easterling Monty and Sherry apparently had an often on again marriage however Monty claimed that he was in the process...

08/09/2022,Do NOT Buy From Kylie Cosmetics Before You See THIS…,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv3PFTqGaI,30-17,i did not just wake up today to kylie jenner pulling a danielle cone on us and breaking lab protocol by wearing no gloves or hair net i mean you know i would sell a clump of hair if i ever find it in my kylie makeup all jokes aside y'all there is a lot of drama going down in the hollywood industry at the moment that i feel like we need to address in today's video because why the hell are people canceling olivia rodrigo for an old drama yeah guys it gets worse than that so make sure to stay tuned to find out what happened this week with kylie jenner olivia rodrigo taylor swift and more you know i always question myself on whether i should make a video dragging kylie jenner for all her scandals because what curse does this woman have to her ability to not get cancelled i mean if you want me to list all the controversies she's been in it would probably take me hours and hours but i guess there's literally no point in that because people will support huge celebrities no matter what happens anyways in my previous video on kylie jenner we addressed how she got canceled by the entire internet after she got exposed for taking three minute flights on her private jet yeah according to multiple headlines that exposed kylie apparently she was causing more co2 emissions than over a thousand average people in one single flight and the fact that many celebrities caused the same risk to the earth is very terrifying and uncontrollable this situation brought so much attention on...
08/06/2022,Addison Rae CANCELED For Mocking Religion?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyKdghvTxEc,29-25,i did not wake up today to addison ray and a clothing brand receiving backlash for mocking and specializing a religion this is way too much for me despite how addison reyes shocked and offended the entire internet this week with her new instagram post charlie dimelio also got into a messy situation on tick tock as well after she got accused of being a bad liar and a homie hopper in her interview you know i've kind of thought about doing a video on addison wright and the horrible situations she's been in on the internet but i thought it would be better if we postponed it due to the controversy that went down between her father and her mother i mean we can all agree that addison and her family had a really rough time a few months ago and i can't really say much about the hate that was floating around on the internet with both addison's parents throwing shade at each other instead of fixing their issues privately this situation made addison and her family receive tons of attention on social media with many media outlets trying to create fake news about the family just to tear them apart however after monty kept adding more fuel to the fire and exposing many of the relationships he had with girls bryce hall decided to step in and involve himself in this messy family situation by defending addison and her mother for being victims in all of this here's what he had to say since dad at the club...
08/03/2022,Jojo Siwa CALLED OUT For Having Internalized Homophobia??,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5o6akBmyYk,25-20,fact that it has been a couple of months since I made a video on Jojo siwa and now she's in multiple dramas is really a lot to take in what happened to you girl we used to be besties if you haven't figured out by the title of this video already yes today we're going to be diving deep into JoJo siwa's recent scandals on the internet and has she managed to beef with a celebrity as well as offend her own sexuality there's a lot to talk about in today's video so without further Ado let's see what Miss siwa has to offer for us this week you know whenever I talk about JoJo siwa on my channel her videos are mostly focused on the Scandal she's been in such as people victimizing her or canceling her for being who she is and aside from that we have also seen videos that address JoJo's dating life and how it caused a major shift in JoJo's personality on the internet ever since she went public with most of her relationships yeah 2021 was a really tough year for Jojo to handle and I'm surprised that she managed to focus on her work more instead of wasting her energy on the internet drama since she's been booked and busy all throughout 2022 with hosting and performing on multiple big shows it just seemed that JoJo was thriving with all the amazing projects she put out this year especially after she let her truth out and changed the internet game forever now of course no one really expected...
07/30/2022,Jojo Siwa DEFENDS Charli D’amelio Over Chase Hudson?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0NTweyfWn4,28-21,okay I don't know what's going on at this point but why the hell is JoJo siwa making fun of Chase Hudson's diss track about Charlie all of a sudden the boredom is really hitting these influencers I swear I don't know why JoJo siwa ended up siding with Charlie Over Chase Hudson but apparently his new song towards Charlie was leaked all over the Internet which caused a huge controversy surrounding Charlie and the horrible things she could have done to chase based on the lyrics he wrote about her in his song we're gonna address all these situations in just a minute so make sure to stay tuned to find out what really went down this week to be honest it was kind of unexpected for Jojo siwa to join the internet this week with a tick tock video dissing Chase Hudson for making a song about Charlie because why on Earth would she get herself involved in a Tick-Tock drama in the first place but I guess the girlies wanted to stick together and support each other during this tough time since both Jojo and Charlie are getting dragged by the entire internet if you have seen my previous videos then you are probably aware of the mess that went down between Chase Charlie and Landon this week and how their managers fans and even clients got involved in it and started spreading fake rumors about each other just to switch the narrative in fact Charlie got Accused at one point of liking a fan edit...
