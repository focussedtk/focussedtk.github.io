03/31/2023,Selena Gomez SHUTS DOWN Rumors On Dating Zayn Malik...,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESbXlMn7oFU,0-20,wow  ot only is Selena Gomez getting called out by the entire internet right now for dating the one and only Zayn Malik but she's also getting dragged for turning against Gigi and Bella Hadid who saw this coming really apparently you guys Selena Gomez has a very dark history when it comes to her relationships with celebrities and no I'm not talking about her situation with Justin Bieber this time because the way she got accused of being a homewrecker and betrayer all in one day left me wondering why people would turn against her all of a sudden I guess you guys have to stay tuned to find out what really happened so without further Ado let's not wait any longer and Jump Right In you know it's kind of sad how Selena went through a lot with her relationships in the past especially after she broke up with Justin Bieber and left millions of fans shocked but what some of y'all don't know is that Justin wasn't the only one who moved on and found the love of his life which was Haley Bieber in fact Selena Gomez began dating the weekend shortly after she broke up with Justin and that's when things started going downhill for her now you might be asking what's so wrong about Selena dating the weekend well in case you guys might have forgotten the model Bella Hadid and the weekend were in a public relationship for almost two years and after they had a big breakup in November 2016 Selena and the weekend began sparking dating rumors two months later at first people were confused whether the weekend and Bella had already broken up a long time ago or the weekend just simply moved on from Bella immediately but then things took a turn once Bella Hadid decided to unfollow Selena on Instagram following the rumors about her relationship with her ex the weekend this situation made many people wonder whether the weekend was cheating on Bella with Selena throughout their entire relationship or not because as soon as Selena got unfollowed by Bella Selena then hit the unfollow button in Return of course fans took to social media to discuss the reasons Bella might have ended her friendship with Selena over the weekend because as far as we knew both Selena and the Hadid sisters had been close friends for years and years and for them to cut each other off felt a bit weird anyways after Selena and the weeknd's relationship became official things then started falling apart between the two as they slowly began distancing themselves from each other and shortly after that they decided to end their 10-month relationship on good terms and remain friends however seven months after the weekend and Selena split up Bella Hadid then entered the scene again and decided to rekindle her romance with the weekend only for it to fall apart again because of Selena yeah guys just imagine how messy this actually was according to reliable sources you guys Bella felt very threatened by Selena throughout her relationship with the weekend as Selena allegedly spoke to the weekend from time to time which infuriated Bella a lot and to make it even worse you guys Bella also feared that Selena might rekindle her romance with the weekend following their breakup in 2019 because not only did Selena try to be on Bella's good side after that but she also played the victim in this situation and pretended that she didn't break the girl code yep I'm not sure if you guys will remember but back in 2019 Selena got called out by millions of people after she decided to follow Bella again and comment stunning on her newest post just to make it seem that the two of them were on good terms but then things took a wild turn when Bella decided to delete the post that Selena commented on and as a response Selena commented under a page reporting on the incident by saying that sucks a lot of people felt that Selena was trying so hard to victimize herself as if she didn't date her friend's Ex two months after they broke up and of course she got dragged by many people who supported her for being a manipulator and a toxic friend although you're after the situation went down between the two Selena and Bella began following each other on Instagram and liking each other's posts for a while but for some reason their friendship struggled to remain intact after Bella decided to unfollow Selena on Instagram again in 2020. forward to this year Selena got called out again for trying to contact Bella again after she went on Instagram stories to post a picture of Bella with the hashtag girl crush and y'all she even posted a tick tock video about Bella with a caption saying that she wishes she was as pretty as Bella to be honest it wasn't really shocking that people were sending hate towards Selena for obsessing over Bella of a sudden because following their friendship history this girl support tactic from Selena came out of nowhere and it kind of made people wonder the reason behind it despite all of that you guys Bella remained silent throughout this entire drama in fact she even refused to follow Selena back on Instagram after she recently followed her anyways let's move on now to her sister Gigi Hadid because even though Bella and Selena were allegedly friends back in the day Gigi and Selena instead were very close I mean according to sources Gigi and Selena met through Taylor Swift over 10 years ago and since then they became close friends as they started hanging out together publicly with their entire friend group however the drama that went down recently between Gigi and Selena made me question their entire friendship and whether Selena and Gigi had altercations behind the scenes in case you guys didn't know Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik used to be in a public relationship for almost seven years and after they ran through tons of problems and family issues they decided to call it quits in late 2021. of course their relationship became a huge topic on media platforms as millions of people were devastated over their split up and how their newborn daughter would be affected by this decision but thankfully you guys it seems like the baby is in good hands now after Selena Gomez became her soon to be stepmom I wish I was joking as we previously addressed in my video Selena and Zayn have been sparking dating rumors for a while now after they both decided to follow each other on Instagram and shortly after that Zayn's own mother followed Selena the next day as well a week later a source confirms on social media that Zayn and Selena were officially dating after they were seen going on a date at a restaurant in New York and y'all even after a tick-tocker who worked at the restaurant where both Selena and Zayn had a date confirmed that both of them were holding hands and kissing at their table so I'm on my way home from work and I'm a Hostess in New York City and I have a friend who's also a Hostess and we both work in restaurants that celebrities sometimes go to and tell me why she just sent me this text message and I checked if they even follow each other and as you can see Zayn only follows 18 people Selena being one of them at first people were wondering whether this rumor was true or not since a lot of tick-tockers nowaday lie about stuff just to gain clout and attention but then things got a bit more interesting when Selena was seen with Zayn's assistant leaving a restaurant in New York it was clear at this point that something was going on between the two especially after Zane's sister reposted Selena's recent post on her Instagram stories however the fans on the other hand were extremely upset over this situation since many of them felt that Selena betrayed both of the Hadid sisters after not only she took the weekend from Bella but she took Zane from GG shortly after they broke up here's what people had to say about the situation wait Selena's dating Zayn who dated Gigi whose sister is Bella who dated the weekend who Selena dated that's interesting just seconds after making up with Haley Bieber she enters Gigi hadid's territory Selena Gomez is becoming a pigment I find it weird how out of all the men Selena picked Zayn he dated Gigi and literally has a child with her she dated Abel II hopped from the Beavers to the Hadid real quick Selena and Zayn please this girl is obsessed with the hadids aren't she supposed to be in the same friend group as Gigi yeah guys a lot of people started saying that Selena has been obsessed with Zayn this entire time after an old interview of her being asked whom she would kiss from One Direction went viral and of course she chose Zayn Malik who would you pick for a kiss oh no Zayn maybe that's it I'm done there was no hesitation there despite all of the drama that people were trying to create between Gigi and Selena Gigi actually responded to the rumors about Selena allegedly dating her ex Zane and y'all this is what an Insider told us magazine Gigi has no problem whatsoever with Zayn dating as long as he is happy and stable and continues to be a good co-parent to their daughter Kai she's fine with whoever he goes out with I would love to hear your opinions on this situation down below but for now make sure to click on the tab above for more videos on these celebs 
03/21/2023,Bad Bunny is in Trouble (sued by ex + kardashian curse),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEre0I1xrLg,122-18,Bad Bunny has been in the headlines a lot lately after rumors have gone around that he's dating Kendall Jenner the news alone has gotten him in some trouble as people are not fans of the Kardashian Jenner family and we're really surprised to see him hanging around one of the members leaving some Vans to feel sort of betrayed by him associating with family that some have called culture vultures and are just surprised that he would want to be around someone in the family some have even joked that dating a Kardashian member comes with a certain Kardashian curse as not so wonderful things have happened said the men in the past who have dated one of these sisters and not just stated because some people even include Rob in this Theory and just say that anyone associated with the Kardashian in general bad things happen to them and with Bad Bunny in the headlines this week for something non-cardashian related some feel like this curse might have hit him you've probably heard the conspiracy theory that the Kardashians curse all the men in their lives and ruin them while they thrive of this include Rob Kardashian from being happy and offered modeling gigs to developing severe depression and never leaving his house Scott Disick who went from being a preppy successful businessman to developing severe alcoholism and depression in front of the whole world Lamar Odom who is at the top of his basketball game that experienced severe addiction overdose died and then was brought back to life Reggie Bush who went for winning Heisman Trophies to shortly after dating Kim having to retire because he got injured and then started playing way worse and had to give his Heisman Trophy back because of a scandal he was in Travis Scott having a number one album in 2018 then becoming the most hated disgrace artist of all time and not releasing an album since Caitlyn Jenner who ruined her relationship with Chris Kim Courtney and Chloe and then got ostracized by her own Community Kanye going on his first 5150 psychiatric hold being locked in a mental hospital his 2020 presidential run and him literally saying he was in the sunken place when he was with Kim Pete Davidson now being in trauma therapy after the negative media attention from being with Kim even though it's not confirmed that he's dating Kendall and Kendall is a Jenner not a Kardashian some still felt like the curse was applying to him since this week news broke that he's being sued by one of his ex-girlfriend his egg scarlease is suing him for at least 40 million dollars over a well-known voice recording that she did for him before he was famous where she says Bad Bunny baby the recording was included in two of his songs and she is claiming in a lawsuit that her voice and the phrase she came up with are being used without her permission and it's not just songs that she feels her voice has been used for the lawsuit states that her distinguishable voice also has been used without her consent for songs records promotions worldwide concerts television radio and social and musical platforms aside from Bad Bunny himself she also seems to be suing his manager as well now these two have a very long history and they dated for quite a while before he was famous I believe they started dating in 2011 and it wasn't until 2015 that she actually did this recording of Bad Bunny baby in which she said that he was working on some music and he texted her wanted her to record this she was with a friend she went to the bathroom where it was the most quiet and recorded it and sent it over to him and in 2016 they actually got engaged and made plans to get married that same year but it was also the hero that he was signed and she got accepted to law school and they ended up breaking up I believe they tried to get back together again but it didn't work out and they ended up going at separate ways I believe there's like more to that but that's as much as I know now the tea of all of this is that back in 2022 there was actually discussions of them about to use her voice for one of his upcoming albums and somebody representing Bad Bunny actually called her up and said that he was willing to give her two thousand dollars if he could use her voice and she said no they never agreed on anything but the audio was used anyway like despite the fact that she declined this offer like they just wouldn't have been put it on the album and the lawsuit claims that people know it's her and since it's released thousands of people have commented directly on her social media networks as well as every time she goes out in public people are always making comments about Bad Bunny baby and the lawsuit states that this has caused and currently causes her to feel worried anguished intimidated overwhelmed and anxious now there is a lot of people feeling a lot of feelings about this I've seen tons of people rooting for her feeling like this is his karma for using her voice without her permission some people are saying that she's just money hungry he's famous now she wants to make money and you know she wants some of his but I don't know I feel like you know she's a lawyer she went to law school he used her voice without her permission like he knows that she declined the offer and of course she's wanting a piece of the pie like since he did go ahead and use it she was also there in the early days watching him come up I mean according to reports back when they were together she was in charge of his scheduling invoices contracts so this is probably all also her coming for a check for all of those times that she helped him rise to fame and he did kind of give her something to sue him over since that is her voice and I mean two thousand dollars that original offer didn't sound too good granted that he's made millions of dollars off of that album and those individual songs so 40 million dollars that is a lot of money and some people are trying to calculate how much she would actually probably get after lawyers fees and negotiations some people are thinking she'll probably land somewhere in 10 million I don't know who knows if this will actually like go through and she'll win but I mean there's a good amount of people that are rooting for her even though there are people that are like she shouldn't get anything I mean at this point those songs individually have millions of views on YouTube one has 355 million views on YouTube and more than 235 million Spotify streams the other one has more than 60 million views on YouTube and 280 million streams on Spotify okay these are huge numbers and so many ears that have heard her voice and I'm just gonna say that obviously if she's a lawyer she knows when is the right time to sue someone and I don't think that she would be doing this if she felt like she was going to lose or if she felt like it wasn't actually something that she could like stand on I don't know and she has to feel strongly about it if she's going to come after a bad bunny because he obviously has a lot of people that love him and that support him and to go against that is is really hard sometimes so the fact that she's standing up for herself that's that's pretty big I feel like the situation would be very different if when his team called her up she was like yeah for sure use my voice in your song and then was like oh I want to sue because I should actually be getting paid for that but since she said no when they called her and they went ahead and used it anyway I just feel like she's in the right here you know like what'd you guys think that she was gonna do like not be upset but people are also taking this as a big time to joke about him and the Kardashians and that curse some people are even joking like him Kardashian is about to like represent him in court and in regards to that curse people are saying that something like this would happen to him after associating with his family thank you so I called the Kardashian curse in one of my first videos when it was confirmed that they were dating and people were telling me I was wrong because she's a Jenner but I think it applies to all of them because they're sisters I don't subscribe to this idea that this group of women are cursed I don't subscribe to that idea but if you do subscribe to the idea that maybe the Kardashians are cursed Bad Bunny is getting sued not only is he getting so that's not funny Bad Bunny and rima's entertainment or being sued by Carly's De La Cruz Benito's ex-girlfriend I think this is definitely a mess but maybe something that he should have seen coming by using the audio and maybe he did maybe he's not even mad that this is happening some people are even trying to like theorize that he did this on purpose because he wanted to be able to give her this money for helping him in his career all this time and he knew that she wouldn't accept the money so he wanted to you know give her away to I was like what this story is getting crazier and Crazier by the minute but either way I hope she gets that money because that's her voice and I feel like it's deserved but like I said there's a lot of opinions going on there so some people might think that maybe she doesn't maybe some people will think that she's money hungry a bunch of stuff there's a lot of opinions going on I will say though that in terms of the part of the lawsuit that she talks about social media and how people associate her with Bad Bunny baby it is true she has her Instagram comments turned off and I can only imagine and that it is because that might have been the only comments that she was getting there for a while and I'm also so sure that with his lawsuit people would even try to comment that even more especially people that are upset at her pursuing him so I can imagine it being annoying if you said that you did not want this line to be in the song using your voice and then everybody knows and then everyone's commenting about it especially if you didn't want it like it's one thing if you did but if you didn't that's like a whole other thing because when she originally recorded it he wasn't bad bunny like he wasn't headlining coach hella bad Bunny and she didn't agree for it to be on this album all these years later when he was bad bunny but that's what's going on with Bad Bunny I certainly want to know what you guys think about all of this do you guys think this is all because of that Dane Kardashian curse that this is all happening to him do you guys think that she has a right to sue and get this money what are your thoughts on the situation let me know in the comments below I love you guys so so much and I'll talk to you in the next video bye guys [Music] thank you 
03/05/2023,Doja Cat is Being CONTROLLED By The Illuminati?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9671xMrvQTI,104-20,Doja cat is getting humiliated by the entire internet for allegedly joining the Illuminati and the worst part about it you guys is that there are also speculations that she's worshiping the devil now aside from Doja having one of the worst weeks this month she also went through a lot with people trying to drag her down with their stupid accusations and we all know what happens when these accusations go public because we've seen Sam Smith going down with them as well a couple of weeks ago but unfortunately the situation with Doja is a bit skeptical and controversial and I think it needs to be figured out ASAP before it's too late throughout doja's career we've seen her getting dragged canceled and even mocked by millions of people on social media for multiple reasons and despite how she was extremely close to ending her career she managed somehow to get herself out of these situations and thrive in the music industry without any issues however she did attract a lot of problems over the years as she was still new in the music industry and well this caused her to get body shamed by the internet after she lost tons of weight by starting a new diet and rehearsing for her performances this situation made a lot of people throw hate at Doja for being skinny and as a result Doja began embracing her body more on media platforms without giving any attention to people who are only looking at her for her physical appearance I mean in her situation it kind of sucks that people were focusing on her body more than her art and even Doja herself spoke multiple times about how she wished that she could release music without dealing with the consequences that came with the success such as privacy Fame and self-image even though this seemed pretty difficult for Doja she actually remained pretty humble and kept her quirky Persona throughout her career without feeling the need to act like a celebrity and try to be cool in front of her fans but unfortunately this feeling did not last for Doja at all and as much as she wanted to feel good and free about herself and her art people still had some harsh words to throw at her especially after she shaved her entire head and eyebrows it all started last summer when Doja went on IG live to shave her eyebrows in front of her fans and immediately people started accusing Doja of taking drugs as her actions seemed pretty stupid and weird for a celebrity to do however this was only the tip of the iceberg for Doja after thousands of people went online to complain about her recent pictures on Instagram and how they looked hella weird and this you guys raised tons of concerns on social media as people began invading doja's in Instagram live to accuse her of taking drugs that stuff is so it's it's really heavy it's a heavy thing and it's kind of funny because I I always was the person to be like posting dumb [ __ ] on the internet like I mean for for example I made moo I have a song called like I'm a cow and I'm like rapping about like literally being a cow and like I got famous off of that so it's just funny to me that people are in any way like shocked after Doja cleared up people's concerns she started making headlines again with news outlets comparing her to Britney Spears and trying to raise awareness about her mental health but thankfully Dojo took this time to focus on herself instead of responding to hate after she began experimenting with her new look by drawing different styles of eyebrows on her face and changing up her hairstyle at this point people were kind of getting used to doja's shaved look especially after she went on multiple fashion shows with over-the-top outfits and makeup and to be honest everything was going completely fine at that moment until she decided to attend Paris fashion week with a very controversial look this appearance right here started the Illuminati allegations against dojo and the reason for that is because of her makeup aka the black eye look some people began speculating that Dojo was mocking people who suffered from While others accused her of joining the black eye Club as you all know the black eye Club is part of an Illuminati ritual all but let's not get into the details about it although this raised tons of speculations about Doja people weren't really prepared for what they were about to see after Doja decided to throw a birthday party for herself with an Eyes Wide Shut theme and a Freemason 27 Club cake of course the symbolism behind doja's theme party was from the movie eyes wide shut but for some reason people thought that Doja had officially joined the Illuminati especially after she forced her friends to wear masks inside the event and had an Illuminati symbol on her Cape couple of weeks later things started to get weird again with the conspiracies after Doja posted random pictures of herself with red contact lenses to be honest Dojo was enjoying all the rumors about her at first as she was cracking jokes with her fans about the Illuminati holding her hostage you guys please be quiet about the Illuminati because everyone is finding out and we want to keep it secret sorry she even posted this Tick Tock video of her mocking people who were trying so hard to link her recent actions with the Illuminati So lately I've been uh hanging out with my cats a lot playing lots of video games watching movies I did watch um Stuart Little um today and it was so sad it made me cry but then like things got better in the end um another thing was that Illuminati Illuminati Illumina a month later the Illuminati allegations came back real hard after Dojo revealed her huge collab for dazed magazine and of course her photo shoot pictures stirred up a lot of attention on social media after tons of people pointed out how Doja looked possessed and terrifying in her photo shoot as a result Doja decided to put her photo shoot picture as a Twitter profile to scare people off and she even tweeted about people being threatened in her Instagram comments by saying this people sound so threatened in my Ig comments today poor babies this world later in the day she went on Instagram live to address the rumors about selling her soul and how funny it is that people are taking it very seriously I feel like I'm in elementary school and people were like oh did you sell your soul yet and then they run away it feels like it's a bunch of like seven-year-olds being like hey Dojo did you say your soul and then they run as fast as they can away from me DoJo took a break from social media afterwards to focus on doing music although she did return at the end of January to attend the Shia Pirelli fashion show and while she went there with 30 000 Swarovski crystals on her body after she spent five hours in the makeup chair covering herself with red paint and crystals as expected people tried to connect her outfit with the Illuminati again somehow however this time accusations went a bit too far after conservatives on social media decided to accuse Doja of worshiping Satan and that her dress symbolized the devil at this point Dojo was tired of all the stupid rumors people were making about her on the internet and as a result she went on Twitter to claim that she will continue doing deliberately weird stuff just to piss people off this Illuminati is so funny to me I'm gonna keep doing deliberate weird just to make those people uncomfortable I for real found a new outlet of Joy playing with people's ignorance and stupidity for my own happiness and personal gain app after Doja made those tweets she went silent for a couple of weeks to avoid any made-up rumor about her and for whatever reason people thought that Dojo was going back to normal after she posted new Instagram pictures with a caption that said this felt like doing a pretty beat for you boring lemon water is out there so you can shut the [ __ ] up now and leave me the alone ciao you won't imagine the amount of positive comments people left under this picture of Doja since many of them began convincing her to go back to the way she looked AKA having normal makeup and hair but unfortunately it didn't take weeks for Doja to start a huge fight with her fans about this situation after she went on Tick Tock live to rant about how she dislikes everybody and y'all she even ended the live with a quote unquote buy from the Illuminati I just don't like you I don't like a lot of y'all and I'm just here to shame guilt bully um so I just don't like I don't like this establishment do I like some of the Heat and the [ __ ] fire that comes out of this app yes do I save tick tocks because there is only gold in my algorithm because I have a beautiful algorithm yes I love it I love it and the Illuminati said bye after this situation happens goja went on the next day to post a very controversial photo shoot of her dressing up as a devil this photo shoot specifically started a lot of drama on social media after many huge gossip Pages such as at the shade room started repenting and apologizing for reposting doja's demonic photo shoot on their page as soon as Doja started trending because of this situation she then went on Instagram to post new pictures of her wearing a crochet devil ski mask to make people uncomfortable and y'all the amount of hate comments Dojo received over these pictures was insane too since many people started threatening her in the comments that they will no longer support her and that she needs immediate help now I have to unfollow let's not normalize this bye loser you sold your soul Doja why I will no longer support an artist who is in direct spiritual opposition to my savior whom I serve damn shame seeing you go down this path seriously what happened I would love to hear your opinions on this situation down below but for now make sure to click on

02/24/2023,Sam Smith HECKLED by Stranger for Being DEMONIC?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-eTkCfm4cA,101-18,Sam Smith just got heckled in the streets of New York for not only being queer and happy but for also promoting Satanism to his younger audience the main question is when did this hate train towards Sam Smith all begin and why are people now throwing dirt on Sam's name for no reason despite them being confident and open about their true identity we're gonna address all the answers to these questions shortly but first let's go back to 2019 where it all started in case you guys didn't know Sam Smith's career goes all the way back to 2012 when they started performing as a child and scored their first hit to a song called Latch but their press coverage came in 2009 when Sam's mother a banker making over 500 000 pounds a year sued her employer after being fired and instead of Sam's mother using the money for herself she decided to promote Sam's pop career while at the office two years later Sam began working extra hard on music in which they released their first debut album in the Lonely Hour in May 2014 and y'all this album featured tons of hit singles such as stay with me I'm not the only one like I can and la la all of these four singles gained more than 10 billion streams you guys including YouTube views and honestly this was the moment where people saw something in Sam a year later Sam proceeded to release a song for the James Bond movie Specter called writings on the wall which also broke tons of records as well and y'all at this point in time people were really obsessing over Sam despite how they came out as gay publicly in 2014 after they acknowledged a two-month-long relationship with the actor and model Jonathan zizel yeah for some reason not that many people were bothered about Sam's sexuality especially after they dropped another album in 2017 and released a music video for the single too good at goodbyes that represented the lgbtq plus Community but then things took a huge turn for Sam's career once they decided to come come out as non-binary in September 2019 Sam shared an Instagram post announcing that they will be changing their pronouns to they them and this came after Sam decided to embrace themselves after being at war with their gender today is a good day so here goes I've decided I am changing my pronouns to they them after a lifetime of being at war with my gender I've decided to embrace myself for who I am inside and out I am so excited and privileged to be surrounded by people that support me in this decision but I've been very nervous about announcing this because I care too much about what people think but yeah I understand there will be many mistakes and misgendering but all I ask is you please please try I hope you can see me like I see myself now thank you ever since Sam came out as non-binary they have been very supportive and open about donating to multiple lgbtq plus Charities and organizations in fact they even launched their own charity aimed at helping young homosexuals to come out to their friends and family as sweet as this was unfortunately the general public was upset and disgusted by Sam's decision as not only did they find it weird how Sam came out suddenly as non-binary but they even couldn't accept the idea to call Sam by their current pronouns as they were used to their old pronouns which were he him this made Sam support the non-binary and trans Community even more in fact Sam also became confident with who they were after they began posting pictures of themselves half naked to support body positivity for their Audience by the way I keep this topic in mind because we're going to address it later in the video but at that time you guys the majority of people were being supportive of Sam's decision and as a result of that Sam decided to release another album in 2020 that opened up about their Journey with self-discovery and acceptance now here's where the hate train towards Sam All Began because after they dropped an album and went on a break for a couple of years Sam returned with a new snippet of their song called Unholy that featured Kim Petras foreign [Music] [Laughter] immediately on Tick Tock after millions and millions of people began posting about it and asking Sam to release it officially for some reason Sam decided to delay the release of the song which threw a lot of people off especially after they demanded the song for a while and it got to the point where the song became annoying before it even dropped after Sam decided to post millions of videos promoting the song with the same snippet yeah guys one video that gained a lot of attention on social media was a clip of Sam promoting the song In the Streets of London after a resident found them awkwardly filming a tick tock for it under her apartment A lot of people clowned Sam Smith on social media because of this video but thankfully a month and a half later Sam finally released the song officially with Kim on streaming platforms and despite the hatred towards the song already it actually charted at number one on the billboard hot 100. following the release of this song Sam and Kim performed their collab for their fans multiple times at different festivals and concerts and as a result of that people decided to Bully Sam and Kim for entertainment after they made a meme out of the clip of the audience screaming in Terror at Sam and Kim's performance a couple of weeks later people began a huge hate campaign towards Sam on social media after they started body shaming them for sharing multiple pictures on social media of them wearing bathing suits and being comfortable with their skin and keep in mind this hatred towards Sam's body just came recently as people were fully supportive of them posting body pictures years ago on social media it's weird to think about not gonna lie but following the body shaming comments that Sam received they decided to piss millions of people off a month later after they released a music video for the new single I'm not here to make friends and somehow a lot of people found the music video very disturbing after they went on Twitter to point out how Sam was promoting photography and sexual activities to their younger audience after this Sam released their highly anticipated album Gloria which debuted at number seven on the billboard 200 and a couple of days later they attended the Grammys with Kim to perform their hit single Unholy and wore all red on the red carpet now we all know what happened afterwards at the Grammys because not only did Sam and Kim win a Grammy for their song but they also lost millions of fans and followers as well after they both performed on stage wearing a devil costume you can find more details on this situation in my previous video about Sam but this situation you guys annoyed millions of people especially parents and more conservative people who went on social media to call Sam Smith out for promoting Satanism and having a demonic ritual on stage a couple of days later after Sam began trending because of this topic Sam decided to take advantage of the hateful comments towards them by posting more pictures of their body on social media platforms and yet again people fell for it and started body shaming them on media platforms for absolutely no reason at this point the hate towards Sam was being forced and pushed by so many people for no reason and it seems that Sam was smartly using this opportunity to promote their album and their single

02/09/2023,Sam Smith SATANIC Performance is TERRIFYING People...,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMobrXbVLV8,95-18,y'all the 2023 Grammy Awards just went down a couple of days ago and let me just say it was messy as well I mean since when were the Grammys so messy we all know how fans have gone crazy once their favorite artists get snubbed and this is here you guys things went completely out of hand after many celebrities got upset about losing their Awards to other artists and as a result some of the winners became a target of slander and hate to the point where they got bullied by millions of people online just for taking a Grammy award home Sam Smith was one of the Hot Topics this year at the Grammys after they got involved in a huge controversy over their performance and in case you guys didn't know Sam Actually attended the Grammys this year with Kim Petras to perform their hit single Unholy which was nominated for best duo slash group performance but here's where it gets crazy a day before Sam performed their song Unholy at the Grammys they stated that their performance will be over the top and that it will upset a lot of Christians and even though it was highly expected from Sam people were surprised to see that they wore a devil costume during their performance while Kim scaled a large cage in a matching outfit this situation you guys pissed millions of people off especially parents who went on social media and had organic panic over Sam and Kim's performance for the people still wondering why we have a problem with Sam Smith pushing the degenerate and satanic Hollywood agenda we don't want dark nasty energy like this influencing our children WTF is this all about Sam Smith I guess it's part of the sold my soul deal that these Psychopaths make this is some Illuminati double worshiping [ __ ] at the Grammys that Sam Smith prick he needs to be put down despite the hate towards them Sam and Kim ended up winning a Grammy for their song after they won best duo group performance award category and y'all even Kim Petras made history with being the first ever transgender women to win a Grammy award unfortunately this wasn't the only controversy that went down this year after Harry Styles got booed off the stage for winning album of the Year be honest who would have thought that Harry Styles would get dragged the second he stepped on the Grammy's red carpet I mean we all know his outfits are quite questionable sometimes but for some reason a lot of people were upset that Harry Style showed up at the Grammys looking like that after they started calling him a clown and a queer baiter on social media looks like someone's drunk homeless Uncle who works part-time as a clown he's not breaking any gender roles he's only hurting our eyes he needs to stop innovating if you thought things couldn't get any worse well unfortunately it did after Harry had technical difficulties while performing his song as it was and not gonna lie Harry seemed pretty pissed at how everything went horribly wrong during his performance oh anyways on a good note Harry did get nominated with other huge contenders such as Beyonce and Adele for album of the year and somehow you guys here I managed to take the award home after his album Harry's house won a Grammy for album of the Year this situation did not only upset millions of fans worldwide but it even upset Adele herself who was seen unhappy once the presenter announced Harry as a winner thank you yeah you can tell that she was very disappointed based on her reaction but a lot of people are pointing out that Adele probably wanted Beyonce to take the award home hence why she reacted this way nevertheless this wasn't the biggest issue about the situation because the momentary stepped on stage to accept the award many people in the audience started booing Harry and telling him to get off the stage and y'all they were even yelling to Harry that Beyonce should have won the award instead for her album [Music] a lot of people took to Twitter to point out how rude and disrespectful it was for the audience to yell at Harry as if he was the person who was responsible for choosing to win the award that's childish as hell regardless of who you believe should have won to take away from someone's moment of accomplishment is such a rude nasty way it is completely unacceptable sorry but booing or not clapping for a winner regardless of whether you thought they should have won is just so unprofessional and Petty and just rude you don't need to be a fan of him but this is just straight up mean learn some basic human decency didn't Beyonce literally win more Awards than anyone here he has like two y'all gotta share anyways speaking of Beyonce she did actually win the most Grammy Awards this year after she broke the record for the most wins of all time which is 32 Grammys and as a result of that Beyonce delivered a very emotional speech while accepting the award you can tell that this accomplishment meant so much to Beyonce and she did seem very grateful standing on stage while accepting her 30-second award although one of her collaborators Diplo was caught mouthing they bought that as Beyonce was accepting the award which started a lot of speculation on social media about whether Beyonce bought her Grammy Award or not yeah we still have no idea if this is true or not but some people believe that Diplo mouthed I'm part of that since he worked with Beyonce on her album and statistically he would get a Grammy award for it as well now let's move on to cute and funny moments that happened at the Grammys because Adele was surprised by Dwayne Johnson AKA The Rock after she revealed in multiple interviews that she has always wanted to meet him and y'all just take a look at how cute this interaction was Adele also had a very awkward and confusing reaction at the Grammys after the presenter decided to welcome sza on stage with a very descriptive intro about her and y'all just take a look at how confused Adele was album SOS it's been number one on the shots seven weeks and Counting and just think this is a woman who almost became a marine biologist and if she had there would be no theme song for killing your ex please welcome scissor speaking of celebrity reactions the internet also highlighted a very awkward clip of Doja cat after she seemed hella pissed at the Grammys for giving the award to Sam Smith and Kim Petras and her if you thought this was awkward well here's a video of the audience reacting to a random artist winning song of the year after so many people expected it to go to one of the big nominations such as Harry Styles Beyonce Adele or Taylor Swift just like that [Applause] anyways loves I hope you enjoyed this short recap of the

02/09/2023,Miley Cyrus Finally EXPOSES The Truth On Liam Hemsworth Cheating...,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftbQbzAGPqk,94-16,imagine how embarrassing it is for Liam Hemsworth to watch his ex Smiley break tons of records off of a new Shady song about him I would have deleted my social media and traveled to a deserted island if you thought Shakira was the only one who was beefing with her ex this month while Miley Cyrus also did not hesitate to drag her ex-husband in a new song after she shared tons of Easter eggs in her new music video that left millions of her fans speechless but before we get into all the details about the situation let's go back and talk about Miley and Liam's relationship and how they ended up being enemies after dating for almost a decade if you guys didn't know Miley and Liam had one of the most complicated relationships ever in Hollywood in fact their relationship goes all the way back to 2009 when Miley and Liam met on the set of the last song the movie adaptation of the popular Nicholas Sparks novel and shortly after filming wrapped the two confirmed their Roman ants after they were caught making out at an airport unfortunately their relationship didn't go smoothly at first after Liam's representative confirmed in August 2010 that he and Miley had split after months of breakup rumors and y'all at that same time both Miley and Liam were gone separate ways until they got back together a month later a lot of fans were confused about Liam and Miley's relationship and whether they had actually broken up or not but they were seen sharing cuddles and kisses while having dinner in California which allegedly confirmed their relationship on November 2010 Miley and Liam broke up again after sources revealed that their on and off-again relationship was off and that people never know with Miley and Liam and they could be back on at some point even though you might think that their fans had given up surprisingly a lot of them were actually supportive at that time and they had high hopes that Miley and Liam would return to each other at some point until they actually did in May 2012 when Miley and Liam suddenly announced their engagement yeah after the careers as in on again off-again couple Liam proposed to Miley with a 3.5 carat ring from Neil Wayne and y'all this came after the couple revealed that Liam had spent a lot of time with Miley's family and they approve of their relationship together in March 2013 tons of breakup rumors started swirling around the couple after Miley was seen going out in public with her ring off but that did not stop Miley from speaking out about the rumors after she went on Twitter and insisted that she did not end her engagement to Liam I am so sick of LA and sick of the lies that come with it I didn't call off my wedding taking a break from social media hashtag draining even though Miley confirmed that she and Liam didn't break up people still speculated about their relationship after the couple postponed their wedding when they were intended to marry in the summer and guess what it turned out that the couple had already broken up after they called off their engagement on September 13 2013. following their breakup tons of controversies started going around about Liam after he was spotted locking lips with the Mexican singer Isa Gonzalez days after the split and y'all even Miley Cyrus was rumored to be hanging around with Benji Madden after she was caught making out with him at a Halloween party everything was going fine with Miley and Liam throughout 2013 to 2016 after they both got into multiple relationships with celebs and people and y'all they even spoke to magazines about how they will always have love for each other even if they weren't on good terms at that moment this situation made many fans wonder whether there was a chance that Miley and Liam could get back together or not until rumors started floating around that Miley and Liam were back together yeah in January of 2016 Miley and Liam were spotted canoodling and kissing at a music festival after multiple fans witnessed the situation and exposed it on social media and thankfully it did not take ages this time for the couple to announce their relationship again after Miley went on Instagram and posted a picture showing her wearing her engagement ring again despite how Liam and Miley had kept going back and forth with their relationship they actually took it very seriously this time after they stayed together until 2019 but in the meantime Miley was spending her time with Liam in Australia to visit his parents and Liam also spent the majority of his time with Miley's family as well after they shared pictures together and honestly everything was going completely differently this time I mean Miley seemed very happy with her relationship with Liam after she shared a picture of them welcoming 2017 together and y'all they even posted cute birthday pictures for each other on Instagram as well in December 2018 Miley revealed that she and Liam Hemsworth got married after she confirmed that they tied the knot three days earlier in an Instagram post and as sweet as this was the couple did not last more than a year together after they separated eight months later for unknown reasons and filed for a divorce and after a year they settled the divorce and finalized it on February 22nd 2020. of course the internet was thriving once all this was going down since they were sharing controversial videos of I'm trying to control and tame Miley on the red carpet just to throw hate at him but at the same time Miley was going through a lot during her breakup with Liam after she revealed in multiple interviews that she wasn't herself throughout her relationship with him and she felt so controlled by him to the point where she felt she had to be a mom of the house and wasn't the type of person to be so other than this Miley even released a song later on called slide away where she allegedly opened up about how Liam used to consume pills and alcohol while they were dating and how she didn't want to be a part of their relationship anymore forward to this year you guys Miley decided to release her first single flowers from her new album that will be dropping on March 10th and immediately you guys people noticed that Miley released her single on the same day that Liam was born which was January 13th this could be a coincidence but trust me it gets even better because in her new song flowers Miley referenced her old Malibu house with Liam that they used to live in before it got ravaged by California wildfires and y'all this is what she had to say we were good we were gold kind of dream that can't be sold we were right till we weren't built a home and watched it burn while we can't find a confirmed report many outlets claim that Liam once dedicated Bruno Mars's song When I Was Your Man to Miley which is relevant because her lyrics and her new single flowers seem to respond directly to that song's lyrics just stop the video and look at the comparison another link Miley's fans are making to her ex-husband is the suit that she wore in the music video of course it wasn't exactly the same suit but her outfit in the music video was somewhat similar to what Liam wore on The Avengers endgame Premiere red carpet in 2019. aka the same red carpet when a video went viral of him telling her could you behave for once when she pretended to lick him again these are only speculations going around about Miley's new song flowers and the fact that it broke so many records is actually insane because it became the fastest song to reach 100 million streams in Spotify history and y'all it even debuted and number one on the Billboard Hot 100 with 425k sales it's honestly shocking how Miley is still thriving and breaking records 17 years into her career but all the controversies that went around about this song made a lot of people curious whether Miley had intended to shade her ex-husband or not until her sister Brandy Cyrus spoke up about the rumors going around flowers being a response to Liam by saying this but it's so great it's the best PR that could ever happen because it gets people talking about the song and Tick Tock and it's everywhere and it's just so fun to watch it all play out Miley fans I love you is any of it true I'm not here to say oh come on no I'm not you don't have to say which ones are true I'm letting this play out no you don't have to say which ones are true you just need to tell me if some of them are true I don't know come on think you have to it's a first-hand experience situation only Miley knows the truth anyway in this video I do want to point out that Liam Hemsworth is currently getting called out for allegedly dating Miley's ex-backup dancer and before anyone comes after me the rumor is still not confirmed but a lot of fans think that this was Liam's response to Miley's new song about him anyways loves if you enjoyed today's video then make sure to hit that like button and click on the tab for more juicy videos 
01/27/2022,Selena Gomez FORCED To Breakup With New BF?!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJ3ERknHieQ,93-14,people are now trying to control Selena Gomez's relationships again after she sparked dating rumors with Drew tagger of The Chainsmokers and y'all some of them are even forcing her to break up it's not even a joke aside from Selena Gomez getting criticized on the internet for her new relationship Kim Kardashian also got canceled by the entire internet this week after she purchased another celebrity's iconic item and this time it was Princess Diana's diamond necklace I know we're gonna get into all of the details in just a second but for now let's talk about Selena Gomez and how she ended up getting criticized again this week it hasn't been a month since Selena Gomez was body shamed on social media after some Paparazzi pictures of her went viral and y'all guess what she's getting dragged again after she sparked dating rumors with a new artist as you all know Selena's relationships haven't been the best in the last couple of years in fact her past relationships with Justin Bieber left her with tons of trauma end issues not because of Justin specifically but because of the general public bullying her into taking Justin back thankfully Selena was able to talk about the emotional abuse she received from the internet in her recent documentary after she shared how hard it was for her to deal with the hate and drama from Justin's fanbase and how impossible it was for her to go in public without the paparazzi following her and asking her about Justin it just sucks I have no idea what the [ __ ] I'm doing the pressure is just overwhelming because I want to do the best I can the whole song thing he called me this morning about this song with Justin and I was like when am I gonna just be good enough by myself this was eye-opening for so many people especially those who bullied Selena throughout the years because of her relationships but of course this did not stop Selena from opening her heart again to other guys after she dated the DJ Zed Niall Horan Charlie puth and The Weeknd Selena's last public relationship with the weekend ended after 10 months of dating and since then Selena has been very discreet about her relationships with men especially those who have a big following but back in 2021 Selena sparked dating rumors with a cast member of her show how to get away with murder called Aaron Dominguez and to this day the rumor hasn't been confirmed yet even though Selena might have managed to keep her alleged relationship with Aaron a secret she failed this time to keep her new love interest private after she was caught hanging out with the artist drew Taggart from The Chainsmokers if you guys don't know The Chainsmokers well they're an American electronic DJ and production duo consisting of Alex Powell and Drew tagger and they both went viral a couple of years after they released multiple songs that blew up worldwide unfortunately the majority of people have forgotten about The Chainsmokers AKA Alex and Drew but they recently made a very controversial comment in their recent interview that got a lot of people talking after they both revealed they've had three sums with multiple fans in the past how often do people propose threesomes with the two of you and how often have you accepted how often is it proposed not proposed to sell them yeah yeah but it's a lot of man what has happened does it count if it's internationally people were heavily disgusted and disturbed by the comments that Alex and Drew made in the in fact majority of the people on the internet criticized them and started talking about how fans should have left them back in 2017 but this all took a shocking turn just one week later after the news Outlet US Weekly reported that Selena Gomez and a member of The Chainsmokers Drew Taggart were officially dating of course no one believed the news at first since there wasn't really any solid evidence that Selena was in a relationship with Drew but that was until a random Paparazzi caught both Selena Andrew on a bowling date a week later the amount of hate comments Selena received over this news was insane since so many fans felt that Drew was a huge downgrade for her and that she shouldn't be around people like him especially after what he revealed in his recent interview get the brother away from her we know what they did with fans free her from those chains that's like falling into Justin Bieber's long-lost cousin Selena look at me honey this isn't you after reading the threesome news she better get herself checked for chlamydia Selena is has got to be your biggest downgrade after both Selena Andrews started trending on social media over this situation Selena took to Instagram to debunk all the rumors Days Later by announcing that she's single and she likes being alone way too much I like being alone way too much hashtag I am single it's funny how artists are announcing that they're single nowadays just to debunk relationship rumors but surprisingly this announcement didn't age well for both Selena Andrew after they got caught leaving a restaurant together while holding hands at this point fans were hella confused about Selena's relationship status and whether she was actually dating Drew or not but from what it seems you guys Selena is trying her best to keep her relationship private with Drew at the moment hence why she announced that she's single just to keep her relationship away from the spotlight anyways loves let's move on now to Kim Kardashian who decided to disrespect herself and other dead celebrities for trying to own their item again can anyone for the love of God stop Kim Kardashian from obsessing over old items from influential people it's getting ridiculous at this point if you guys have seen my previous videos on Kim back in 2022 then you probably know the mess that went down with her ever since she decided to go to the Met Gala wearing Marilyn Monroe's iconic dress for some reason people were hella upset that Kim borrowed Marilyn Monroe's original dress for the Met Gala only for her to destroy the dress hours later after the company that owned the dressed posted pictures of it as a result of this Kim received tons of backlash on social media for having access to a dead celebrity's clothes and destroying Marilyn Monroe's iconic dress and y'all the worst part about it is that Kim also got gifted a jar of Marilyn Monroe's real hair and just imagine the things that people had to say about her afterwards because not only was she getting dragged for being privileged enough to disrespect the dead and own pieces of their items but she was getting criticized for being ungrateful by pulling these stunts just for attention what is this oh my God I'm literally going to do some crazy Voodoo [ __ ] and I Channel her a couple of months later Kim got attacked again on social media after she announced on her Instagram stories that her daughter North got gifted with Michael Jackson's original jacket that he had wore for his Smooth Criminal music video and y'all people on the internet went insane over this situation since they found it disrespectful that North had the right to own a legendary piece of Michael when his kids have been begging for years to get his stuff now you might be thinking that Kim might have learned her lesson by now after she got dragged multiple times last year for trying to collect iconic fashion pieces but unfortunately this woman made it worse this week after she decided to purchase Princess Diana's famous diamond cross necklace yeah Princess Diana according to TMZ you guys Kim was able to snatch that rare diamond encrusted necklace at Sotheby's auction after she bid on it for 197k and purchased it in immediately so in my opinion I feel like the blame should have been put on the person who sold it instead of Kim since she bought this one herself but surprisingly tons of other people disagreed with this situation after Kim started trending on Twitter with thousands of people attacking her for going after dead people's possessions again I feel like these things shouldn't even be up for sale they need to be given to her family or Harry like why are they just willingly giving her stuff away I swear to God she better not wear it it's a small thing until it's actually creepy and weird and obsessive Kim get the out of the spotlight she's trying to consume the power of these dead women from their memorabilia I would love to hear your opinions on this situation down below but for now make sure to click on the tab above for more juicy videos on these influencers 
01/20/2023,Why HyunA Need To Be Cancelled,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb1EIzIgXNg,111-14,Gianna is a very controversial artist Idol along with other artists like kyolin and Jesse but why well you see South Korea in general adores cute Concepts like twice red velvet pristine Etc Hannah though is more on the scandalous side and on the revealing side which is usually frowned upon however some people actually love this side of her since she shows the reality of becoming a mature woman many also love Hannah for her unusual fashion choices and styling but this time it seems that she might have gone a little bit too far in her recent post on Instagram which was posted a few days ago by the way Kiana shared a series of photos of herself in her usually eclectic Style with a cute short haircut although fans enjoyed the first couple of photos it was the last one that caused controversy in the picture Hannah is seen walking away from the camera in a way that allows the back she's wearing to be seen the bag is a statement piece that looks like a pink Rave bear with harnesses goggles and other unusual accessories I guess it's cute right but when you look at the comments on the post they are overwhelmingly about the pink bag fans showed their criticism and disappointment in Jana's ownership of it some of the comments under her post read girl not the bag not this bag please delete not this bag please we love you don't do that but what is it about this bag that many are disappointed in well it takes us back to the recent Valencia AGA controversy at first many people thought this bag was the Balenciaga bondage slash BDSM bear backpack which recently came under Fire for using children in the promotional photos for the accessory to be fair Balenciaga has been known for its seemingly intentionally controversial marketing and design choices still this one was particularly in poor taste and it was extremely poorly received because of the children involved in what is considered a mature item the brand even issued an apology for the criticized promotional photos but that hasn't kept many people from still deciding to boycott the brand however the bag that Shanna is seen wearing is not part of the Balenciaga BDSM bear bag line or even an item from the brand at all it's actually from the brand doll's kill as seen on the company's website but this still didn't stop the flood of criticizing comments but why it turns out doll's kill also has a fair share of its own controversies starting from stealing artwork from other artists to racist behavior and even some very questionable t-shirt designs doll skill has done it all as a result many people have boycotted the brand well seems reasonable enough to me some of the people commenting on Hannah's posts already knew that the bag is from doll's kill but that still didn't stop their disappointment seeing the K-pop Idol supporting them since the brand is still pretty problematic but if the brand is under such controversy why is Tiana going out of her way to promote its products I don't know about you guys but as an artist and a person of influence I don't think Kiana should be presenting the brand it is an insult to all the people who were wronged by dolls kill but guess what this isn't the first time she has worn the brand oh and it gets worse she is also not the only K-pop Idol that has included doll's kill in their outfits groups like itsy and twice have also worn different items from this brand in their recent promotions this brand is actually pretty common among female K-pop Idols in particular wow this is just not right you guys especially for Hannah because she is known to be an artist who speaks and stands up for for what they believe in starting from her four minute days and throughout her solo career Jana has been someone with an unrivaled voice she is also a role model to many young Idols who are growing up and dreaming to be like her and seeing a person in her position affiliated with a brand that is said to be racist and anti-feminist that's just not okay you guys although some people tried to defend her by saying that she was given the product by her stylists others were seen arguing what the probability of her having no idea about the whole situation would be while sharing a clear picture of the bag it's been a few days since hyena shared the picture and there haven't been any apologies from her or her agency to clear up the controversy or explain her side of the story what do you guys think of the situation do you think Kiana should apologize for representing such a brand on her Instagram or are people just overreacting let me know what you guys think in the comment section and don't forget to subscribe foreign [Music] 
01/12/2022,Selena Gomez Opens Up On People Bodyshaming Her..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tTnd3JjM5Y,85-16,we're only one week into 2023 and people are already getting on my nerves again because why the hell are we body shaming Selena Gomez now some of y'all need serious help aside from Selena Gomez getting body shamed by the entire internet Taylor Swift and sizza also got into a fight after Taylor decided to block sizza from getting a number one album and y'all even Bad Bunny got canceled on social media after he got caught in multiple videos being rude to fans and snatching their phones I wish I was joking with that being said let's go ahead and address the first issue surrounding Selena Gomez and people body shaping her you know it's funny how some people preach about body positivity daily on social media and to have those treat people with kindness quotes on their bio but then they go on their way to fully a celebrity the next day just for entertainment make it make sense as we all know Selena Gomez has been a huge top topic of conversation over the last five months ever since her documentary came out since then people have been trying to start rumors about her being rude to her own friends While others made fun of her mental illnesses and accused Selena of trying to gain Sympathy for the media of course a lot of people took sides with Selena in this situation and defended her While others attacked her mostly because of how she became friends with Haley Bieber all of a sudden who has been a huge enemy to Selena for years if you guys missed my previous video on Selena basically Selena had to remove over an hour and a half of footage from her documentary that focused on her past relationship with Justin Bieber and this Behavior annoyed millions of people on social media as they were all anticipating the full truth about their toxic relationship and how it ended up leaving an impact on this generation all this hate towards Selena you guys ended up piling up this week when Selena was photographed by a Paparazzi while she was on vacation in Mexico and y'all the amount of hate comments Selena received on these pictures was insane I mean not only about people bullying her for getting sicker but they were also body shaming her and trying to make fun of her weight by saying that she has been eating way too much just take a look at some of these comments oh she's huge the pop girly who's aging the worst I fear it's time to put the hot dogs Down Selena she needs to hit the gym instead of being obsessed over pretty models yeah imagine how pathetic it is to pick on a celebrity for their weight just to gain some clout and responses on social media but I'm glad Selena handled it the right way and avoided responding to the hate comments anyways let's move on now to Bad Bunny who received tons of backlash right now after he got accused twice of being rude to his own fans not gonna lie to you guys the news about Bad Bunny this week shook me a bit because despite the successful years Bad Bunny had in 2021 and 2022 I never expected him one day to get canceled for being rude to his own fans as we all know Bad Bunny is one of the biggest and most successful artists on Earth in fact he was the most talked about artists in 2022 after he launched his own tour and grossed over 435 million dollars which is the most of any tour in recorded history other than that he even earned the biggest streaming year for any artist in Spotify history with over 20 billion streams just in one year can you imagine I mean it's crazy to think about all of his achievements especially where he came from before his Fame and success but unfortunately this all changed this week once a video of Bad Bunny in public went viral where he seemed to be throwing a Fan's phone in the water after they violated his personal space check this out [Music] I know that wow of course the amount of hate comments Bad Bunny received for his actions was insane as many people attacked him for acting recklessly and being so full of himself when he should have asked the fan to just give him space instead despite all that bad bunny issued a response on Twitter about the situation the next day and let me just say it disappointed tons of people here's what he said the person who comes up to me to say hello to tell me something or just to meet me will always receive my attention and respect those who come to put a phone in my face I will consider it for what it is a lack of respect and I will treat it like one for an unknown reason Bad Bunny deleted his response to the situation a couple of hours later and to be honest I kind of wish that he had kept his response up considering how he got involved in another incident the next day where he got caught snatching another Fan's phone at a club in the Dominican Republic see if bat bunny were to keep his response up he would have been dragged on social media for his hypocrisy because it was a clear as Crystal that this fan at a club didn't invade bad Bunny's personal space whatsoever and for him to snatch this Fan's phone while the fan wasn't even recording him is kind of wrong and immature can't defend him this time let me not lie even if it was Beyonce there shouldn't be a reason when you take someone's personal things and literally break them this is getting so boring just because you're famous doesn't mean you have the right to steal people's phones y'all need to stop supporting him his head getting too big but let's just end today's video with sizza and Taylor Swift getting into a fight and beefing over a number one album we all know by now how both sizza and Taylor Swift released one of the best albums in late 2022. of course Taylor Swift broke tons of records with her album midnights after she took over the entire Billboard Hot 100 with her songs and received the biggest streaming year by a female artist in Spotify history with 13.9 billion streams the same goes for sizza as well she released her most anticipated album this year called SOS after five years and this album was the most talked about album this year after it went viral on social media and became the first r b album by a female artist to spend its first three weeks on the billboard 200. now here's where the drama started between sza and Taylor Swift because as you all know Taylor has been getting called chart obsessed and a scammer for releasing multiple versions of her song anti-hero just to keep it stable at number one on the billboard hot 100. and with this decision being made she blocked both Drake and Rihanna from getting a number one song on the Billboard Hot 100 and at this point she even blocked Mariah Carey from getting a number one as well for her song All I Want for Christmas but thankfully it went number one a month later people thought that Taylor releasing multiple versions for one song to keep it at number one was a total scam but this issue this week was a bit different after Taylor decided to release four digital versions of her album Midnight on her website to make her album reach number one again and y'all this made millions of people attack Taylor for being greedy especially after how sizza's album was going at number one for four weeks straight of course with fans dragging the situation far on social media Susan and her team had to come up with a solution to block Taylor for plating Shady games and getting number one after they decided to release digital exclusives on sza's website as a response and y'all even scissors manager went on Twitter and said this despicable tactics LOL ended Taylor Swift SOS by sza becomes the first r b album by a woman to spend its first four weeks at number one on the billboard 200 since Janet by Janet Jackson in 1993. lol after both sizza and Taylor started trending on social media over this drama sizza decided to go on Twitter to clear up their Rumors by defending Taylor after she clarified that she wasn't competing with her and that she was only trying her best uh I feel silly that I even have to say this but I see supporters arguing and I hate that I don't have beef with anyone especially not Taylor LMAO I genuinely loved her album and all the writing everyone's just trying to do their best as we all should love to everyone good night with Taylor giving zero response towards the situation surprisingly since his album surpassed Taylor and remained number one on the billboard 200 for four weeks straight and of course people had some words to say about the entire situation check this out imagine pausing your rehearsals selling 37 second audio clips for five dollars and making several remixes of a song just to lose Taylor and her 300 remixes failed I'm crying it's kind of insane that

01/03/2023,The Bad Bunny Situation..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHIzE1h-zDk,109-12,Bad Bunny just hit back at a fan who he claims had gotten into his personal space and the way he hit back at her is causing a huge uproar on social media you guys on Monday January 2nd the day after New Year's Bad Bunny was seen walking down the streets of Dominican Republic and he ended up having a crowd of his fans formulate pretty quick of course with someone of a big name in the music industry like Bad Bunny I think it's safe to say that these celebrities have almost little to no privacy when it comes to stepping out and that's exactly what ended up happening with Bad Bunny this week but some think the invasion of privacy went a little too far as Bad Bunny was seen walking down the streets and many of his fans swarmed around him to get a closer look and meet him in person one girl did something that that bunny thought was completely off the grid and what Bad Bunny did in response to this girl getting up all in his face with her phone has created a lot of mixed reactions on social yeah and Bad Bunny has even come forward to speak out about those so if you guys were wondering why this video clip has gotten pretty controversial especially over on Twitter to the point where not only Bad Bunny started trending but this clip has gotten over a million views in just a couple of hours well it's because of bad Bunny's response to the way he ended up dealing with a fan who is invading his personal space let's just say he decided to grab her phone and throw it in the water yeah he completely tossed the girl's phone and you can also see the shocked look on the Fan's face as she comes to realization with what just happened foreign [Music] [Music] and I'm sure she wasn't expecting that at all but I guess it was only a matter of time for a Bad Bunny to stand his ground and stick up for his personal space at least that's what he claimed to have done now from what it looks like in the video it seemed like the girl whose phone was thrown down the Water by Bad Bunny seemed to initially be attempting to get a selfie off of Bad Bunny but others think she was holding her phone in front of the rapper for just way too long just screaming and yelling as he's simply trying to just make his way home to which other is Justified that what bad bunny did was okay because at that point it seemed like the fan was just disrespecting Bad Bunny and not taking into account his personal space at all some are saying that at the end of the day he's human he might have just had a long day and that it just wasn't necessary for the girl to have the phone all up in his face while simultaneously yelling like that and that it was just a matter of time for a Bad Bunny to do something about it but others on the other hand think that what bad bunny did was discuss testing and just take a look at what many people have been having to say about this there's been a whole debate over on Twitter with some saying what makes celebs think they can act like this this sucks because I feel like it could have definitely been handled differently and those men around him isn't his security if he doesn't want them doing that they need to do their job and protect him or don't get in his space if somebody invaded my personal space I'd do the same a rich person having no regard for the property of the working class are we shocked that's absolutely rude and disrespectful these are the people who pay your salary the least you can do is treat them with some respect you don't have to want to take a photo but you can politely ask them to leave rather than throw their possessions someone responded saying everyone pays everyone's wages that got to do with personal space people need to stop acting like celebrities are their best friends you're a complete sharing to them you can't just run up invade their personal space and start recording actually yes you can they chose that life without fans they wouldn't sell records and this person responded saying you can be a fan without her and invading someone's personal space LMAO the conversation continues someone saying as a celebrity that's literally what you sign up for though these are the kind of people that make you famous and quite literally the reason you have the kind of Lifestyle you do I love Bad Bunny but that was foul so celebrities sign up to get hurt and run up on out of nowhere I thought it was so they could share their music with the world nah he could have stopped right there and asked her to back off instead he smiled to lure her into a false sense of security and then grip the phone out of her hand and threw it there are ways to deal with that sort of thing and that wasn't it Bad Bunny then decided to come forward on social media himself and speak out about the this whole situation saying that what the girl did was not tolerable even if she was a fan he initially tweeted out in Spanish which translates to the person who comes up to me to say hello to tell me something or just to meet me will always receive my attention and respect those who come to me to put a phone in my face I will consider it for what it is a lack of respect and I will treat it likewise but Bad Bunny has still gotten a lot of criticism on social media for throwing the woman's phone away and a lot of people think that was completely out of line on his end while the other majority of social media Justified what Bad Bunny did one girl over on Tick Tock made some interesting remarks and she explained why she thinks the girl was at fault so let me tell you guys why I'm not really mad at this I'm just gonna choose when I say this and if I lose followers I'm sorry but I feel like somebody like Bad Bunny whose impact and fame is at the magnitude of what his truly is he and so many other celebrities should start making examples out of people like this oh but that's what they signed up for they didn't sign up for you to be all up in their personal space not giving them even the slightest amount of basic regard for their [ __ ] to my understanding this was on New Year's Eve who the [ __ ] was to be on that New Year's Eve now let's consider some things maybe she was high maybe she was drunk or whatever it doesn't matter you need to be respecting people's personal space celebrities did not sign up for this type of they are not some type of wax figure that you can just walk up to and be like oh let me take a picture let me take a video don't do that man be respectful it definitely seems like this young lady had to learn it the hard way but many people are still opposed to what Bad Bunny ended up doing some even bringing up how it was morally wrong to just take this girl's property and just completely throw it away saying like who knows if this girl is able to afford another phone or how hard she worked for it things like that it's also important to note that recently in an interview with billboard Bad Bunny shared his plans for 2023 and this incident happened in the very beginning of 2023. Bad Bunny had made plans that he wanted to take a break in 2023 and of course having to know that this was how his 2023 would have started was probably not in his best interest he said 2023 is for me for my physical health my emotional health to breathe enjoy my achievements we're going to celebrate let's go here let's go there let's go on the boat I have a couple of sporadic commitments and I'll go to the studio but there is no pressure remember yourself you've worked off anyways guys that's what's been going on with Bad Bunny and this recent viral clip of him that's been going around and many people justifying as well as not justifying what he did I definitely want to know where you guys stand on this situation definitely let me know your thoughts in the comments down below love you guys so much and as always I'll see y'all in the next video foreign [Music]
