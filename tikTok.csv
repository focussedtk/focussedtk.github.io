03/23/2023,Mom Influencer In Huge Trouble (Son taken Away),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMUvNoPDA0,128-14,I've talked to you guys a lot about family channels over the years and how harmful it can be to share Children online between parents embarrassing their children pranking children there's been so much out there that should not be the exploitive nature of these videos have been a big topic as more and more channels have popped up over the years and it isn't just on one single platform parents posting their children and making them the stars of their content stems across all platforms but this that we're talking about today is quite a sad story and goes to show you that sharing Children online comes with a lot and the internet is a powerful place and all parents need to be careful about what they're putting out there and how it can come across honestly I think this story goes for people that have literally one follower to millions of followers this could truly happen to anyone if your video goes viral of your kid you should be careful with what you're posting a tick tock mom recently found out just how powerful the internet really is after she shared a video of her husband and her son and in the video I'm not gonna show it but her husband basically robbed their child in Saran wrap from like his neck to his knees he was falling over I don't know why they thought this was some light-hearted funny video because it wasn't it was just weird and not something that should be put online it was embarrassing and sad just hard to watch overall and the video went viral and as a result people who viewed The Tick Tock reported the parents to child protective services and The Tick Tock ended up getting deleted but that didn't cause the issue to go away as CPS took these claims of concern seriously and actually remove their son from their home the mom ended up posting a video about it on Tick Tock the next day explaining her side of the situation no we're dealing with a situation where Gunner has been taken from us until cprs can evaluate our home because I posted a video of my husband and son playing video was strewn away as two people thinking that we were abusing our child one Gunner was like laughing and smiling and it was just a funny thing that Hank did um because Gunner was getting into like the stove that day and like tried putting a fork in his socket and um like Hank like playfully wrapped them and clean rap He had room to move like he looked like a little worm Like A Little Cucumber it was at no point in distress or crying or anything like that like we would never hurt ours our son like we would never hurt our our child she begins to explain that at first she was getting positive comments so she thought nothing of it and then later on cop showed up at her door over this video they questioned her and her husband and she thought that her son was going to be returned to her after this and CPS could evaluate their house but that wasn't actually the case we went down and like made her statements and thinking that like Gunner was gonna like be returned to us that day um and that like CPS would do their investigation and see that our home is safe um and now we met our child no harm I don't know what to do um whether to stay quiet or post a video or like private my my uh social media because of the amount of hate that I'm getting I don't know what the right thing is to do or to say all I all I can say is that my son so loved and cherished my miracle baby like he's my was my fourth pregnancy after three miscarriages and he's the light of my life she begins to explain that people are interpreting the video wrong she isn't like a Family Channel or anything like that she's just an influencer who happens to be a mom and she says that even though she has like a million followers her Tick Tock is not monetized she's not making money off of her kid or anything like that some people are are taking this contact s and like not even knowing hankara I make zero money off of my off my social media my Tick Tock is not monetized like at all any money off of my kid I just post little Vlogs sometimes and like little pieces of like our life together and um feel really helpless in this situation I feel so dumb reposting for boosting that and like thinking it was just like a cute Family Video and then it turning into this I know that people are gonna are gonna hate me or like just like have opinions on this and like I unders I absolutely understand that I just want people to know that like I I love that little boy more than anything in the whole world and I would never hurt him never ever some disagreed with her description of the video that she had posted feeling like it wasn't a light-hearted video like she said it was but they did feel for her and hoped that this will cause her to change what she chooses to share of her son online the next day their son was returned to them and she shared a video on Tick Tock saying home where he belongs CPS cleared us of wrongdoings and determined our home with us is a safe one for our son despite that a hard lesson was learned a mistake we will never make again this weekend was extremely traumatic for us as a family and will be taking time away to heal I feel like this was a major lesson to not just her but a lot of people that way you share online does get seen by the public in their serious consequences that can come with sharing your children online now there are a lot of people feeling like this was very extreme for them to take away her child it is extremely traumatic that is for sure sure and it is such a sad story and I will say that throughout the years of seeing family channels and people just share their kids online there are comments that you see about people being like we're a CPS or like why hasn't anyone reported them to CPS and family channels have complained about getting calls from CPS but I haven't ever really seen it happen when they do remove the child from the home I think it's only happened like one other time that I know of with a family channel so to hear about this I was like shook you guys I was like this is really really crazy and it's just sad something that you don't want to see happen and I do think as the years go on people will start to see more and more why sharing Children online just isn't the best idea preserving their online identity until they can understand it for themselves seems to be the best whether you're famous or not people find it embarrassing enough when parents bring out the baby books but imagine the whole freaking baby book is online like on Facebook on Instagram Tick Tock YouTube it's overwhelming nobody wants to see your kids first bath except for creeps like keep that stuff to yourself it's truly it's better it's better for everyone and your kids will thank you and The Internet's been around long enough for kids who have grown up online to now speak out about their experiences growing up on the internet in hopes that other parents will listen to them and protect their own kids from the same feelings that they are experiencing an article was recently published in Teen Vogue titled influence her parents and the kids who had their childhood made into content this article details Claire a girl whose parents currently run a Family Channel her name had been changed for the article to protect her identity because she's still living at home with her parents but wants to speak out as soon as she can live on her own with like her real name and everything but until then she wants to keep Anonymous but she did share kind of what she's going through as this teenager living with her parents who have this channel the article says search clear his name online and this is some of what you'll find photos of her as a child merchandise with her face on it available for sale and a YouTube channel with millions of subscribers and hundreds of videos featuring Claire and members of her family in the videos Claire grows from a toddler to a teenager on Instagram fans comment they miss videos from the old days in public people sometimes recognize her and ask for photos altogether the family's YouTube channel has over a billion views but if it were up to Claire none of the videos would exist the first time she went viral she was a toddler when the family's Channel started to rake in views clear says both her parents left their jobs because the revenue from the YouTube channel was enough to support the family and to land them a nicer house and new car that's not fair that I have to support everyone she said I try not to be resentful but I kind of am when she told her dad she didn't want to do YouTube videos anymore and he told her they would have to move out of their house and her parents would have to go back to work leaving no money for nice day things when the families together the YouTube channel is what they talk about Claire says her father has told her he may be her father but he's also her boss it's a lot of pressure she says when Claire turns 18 and can move out of her house she's considering going no contact with her parents when she doesn't live with them anymore she plans to speak out publicly about being the star of a YouTube channel she'll even use her real name Claire wants people to know how her childhood was overshadowed by social media stardom that she didn't choose and she wants her parents to know nothing they do now is going to take back the years of work I had to put in she also claimed that she didn't even know how much money her parents had actually set aside for her to use in the future they had claimed that they saved money for her college but she isn't sure how much of that is versus what she actually made for them all these years it truly is just so sad to hear that this is the reality for Claire but also the reality for so many other children online whose parents make them the source of income and not even that because there are so many people who try to get to the this level by posting things on tick tock on Instagram on Facebook on YouTube of their kids and they never make it to this level where they have millions of subscribers but the fact that they like try to get to this level by posting stuff of their kids that's like so sad to me as well the people that like seek out this life now I do think that there's different levels to the way people share their kids online obviously there are family channels where the children are like the main characters of their videos and everything but then there's influencers who just so happen to have kids and they've logged their life and I don't think that that is that bad but I do think that this story as a whole these two that we talked about today it just goes to show you that you should just really be mindful of what you are sharing of your kids online so maybe think twice before sharing something but as of right now the situation remains as it is pretty much like unmonitored except by the public and now we've seen like how extreme it kind of can get when the public does get involved I just found this to be such a crazy story and just so sad at the same time but I certainly want to know if you guys have heard about this and or what you guys think about this whole situation including this Teen Vogue article let me know your thoughts in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys [Music] no no no no no no no 
03/16/2023,This TikToker Keeps Getting Cancelled (Tara's World),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0YHDuMV_oU,129-13,take talker Tara has been getting in a ton of trouble lately a lot of my for you page has been people stitching her videos and talking about what's wrong with what she just said she's had a couple viral moments and they haven't really gone viral for a good reason that's for sure some I think are funny like how she unknowingly spent thirty thousand dollars on Harry Styles tickets I spent thirty thousand five hundred ninety nine dollars on how are you concerts I'm a gum I'm gonna go like work and pretend like I didn't pay Harry's electric bill for like the next 10 years how does that even happen like not a reason to hate her but tons of people were coming for her I mean it's her money probably not the smartest move but who are we to judge I guess she's making a bag she's spending a bag on Harry Styles um but I mean that was shocking definitely not hate worthy but I was shook when she said thirty thousand dollars but other things that she said have actually gotten her in real trouble and a little bit more deserving of a conversation Tara recently moved apartments and she's been filming a ton of tick tocks showing outside of her window talking about what's walking distance to her apartment and she's even talked about the amenities that her apartment building offers and people warned her that this was pretty dangerous and that there are scary people out there that will remember this stuff and she should really be careful with what she shares online and people were also under the impression that she had to move out of her previous Apartments because of strangers finding her address offended more than anything she actually responded to people saying that she was safe and people need to mind their own business and they have no lives just talking about her and hating on her for no reason everybody on here seems to think that I move every month because people are finding out where I live and stalking me no and even if people found out where I lived it really wouldn't matter I live in like an extremely high security building so like who cares I'm also not Kardashian oh my God she moves like every month I moved once a year and it was all for like good reasons y'all got nothing better to Doom she moves like every month because she always gives away the location of her apartment because she's dumb in an airhead get a life right get a life I'm so I'm like so tired of that and in the comments people were not pleased by this saying bro you need a reality check regardless of the security of your building please be careful I think people are just genuinely concerned love there are crazy people out there this is giving I'm untouchable I can never be in danger I think people are worried about you I think it comes from a good place you're mad fans care this tone is giving mean girl energy now I will say that I do think people were confusing her for another tick tocker Tabitha because they were both moving around the same time and Tabitha actually did say that she was moving because people found her address and were coming to her door and made a whole Tick Tock about it so as you guys know I'm finally moving because someone leaked my address and if you were wondering it's currently 9pm and this is what I'm dealing with I'm moving tomorrow I can't wait so I'm pretty sure people were just confusing them and Tara actually just moved because she wanted to move but I mean people were concerned they feel like they didn't really deserve to be attacked for being concerned about her get a uh life no Tara you don't get to be mad people would kill to have that many people online concerned about their well-being total strangers okay you are chronically online weekly talking about you're being paranoid that somebody's following you or in your apartment or whatever so you don't get to be mad that people are a little concerned when you're showing people a complete map to what you're doing in your new neighborhood with addresses and everything in the background and there's a lot of young impressionable women on the internet that follow you and might think of you as an example and they need to know that it's not okay to post all of those little details in the background because those little details could be a fine line between life and death for some people you need to like listen to a true crime podcast or watch like a Netflix documentary because I just don't think you're getting it but you don't seem to want anybody to care so godspeed after this whole drama another one of Tara's posts started going viral because she was doing a get ready with me talking about how she's straight but she enjoys kissing girls and talks about how her boyfriend likes it and how guys like seeing that and also talked about how her ex never liked her doing that she didn't understand why she found it weird that he didn't like her kissing other girls everyone is like tweaking out because I hooked up with a girl for work when I have a boyfriend no we are not in an open relationship but he was more than okay with it he literally came over and like hung out with us when we were done also like I'm straight like I've always wanted to like hook up with a girl and like I kiss girls all the time but I don't think I could ever like date a girl I've only ever been like emotionally into like men but I just think girls are hot like that's the thing and it's so fun to like kiss girls you know what I mean I think it was like the third or fourth time me and my now boyfriend were hanging out he brought me to this like event and I saw this girl there that I knew and like we kissed I kissed all of my girlfriends like all the time it's just what we do and he was so excited like his eyes lit up he was like you can do that whenever you want it was the funniest thing ever like he was so excited I remember my last boyfriend well we're never like officially dated but like we basically were he was so insecure about that kind of thing I remember I asked him once I was like how would you feel if I like kissed a girl because most guys like love that he got so mad at me like yelling at me being like I can't believe you want to kiss somebody I was like no not in that way like I just figured I'd ask like he was kind of crazy and like to each their own it was just funny I was like you're lying to me right now like most guys like love that he did not um but yeah I would never like hook up with a guy for my of like even if I didn't have a boyfriend I just wouldn't do that especially if I have a boyfriend I would if like I was like dating the person but I don't think I would just like hook up with some dude but girls are different because they are magical and perfect in time of people replied to this story saying obviously he wouldn't enjoy watching you cheat and also felt like she was baptizing women being together to please men if you and your boyfriend have no problem with you making out with women but if you did it with a man it would be a different story then it kind of shows that you don't think that women loving women intimacy is valid or real except for the pleasure that it gives to the male gays and this is just such an icky Tick Tock oh my God what needs to be said has already been said I mean this video is actually incredible it was it's almost like it's scripted it's like what not to say after what not to say after what not to say after what not to say but I think the cherry on top of this the one of the more subtle spits in the face is that you made me agree with this straight man when he was you know talking about what it means to be a queer woman oh my god dude oh my God hey Bae so how would you feel if I cheated on you I would not like that what the it turned into a whole thing and she responded on Tick Tock with this on this week's episode of what am I getting canceled for I am homophobic and fantasizing lesbians because I like to kiss girls welcome to my world this is better than cable I'll tell you that much who needs obx3 when you have my comment section you know what I mean I have a couple of things that will really piss you guys off hold on I love kissing girls like suck cry about it and honestly if you if your entire life mission is to sit on your couch and scrutinize my every move if we're being real it's kind of entertaining so you can keep going but man do I feel bad for you and just recently she went on a Brianna chicken fries podcast and talked more about all the hate that she's been getting recently I was out at dinner like a week ago like getting drunk with my boyfriend we were like I was so wine drunk and Lila called me you guys know Lila yeah right yeah so she called me and she was like I wanna like hook up for only fans I was like no what'd she say she was just like oh like let's just like make out and like pillow fight yeah I have like a naked pillow fight for only fans I was like no like I want to like be in the past sorry let's go I was so drunk I was like yeah duh like I want to do that so bad um so we like made a plan to do it and then I made like a get ready with me to like to like do it and I was just saying like oh yeah like I love kissing girls like it's so fun like I've always wanted to like hook up with a girl but like I've only ever dated guys like I'm pretty sure I'm like straight in that way I just like think girls are hot I like to kiss girls like when I'm out drinking like I always kiss girls or whatever and like people took that as like I lesbians and like just like like that like I'm like I've internalized homophobia like all these crazy narratives came out of that and I was just like okay like I didn't even know how to respond to it you know have you responded to it at all no I made like there was a few comments talking about like oh like how like she's cheating on her boyfriend but he didn't care so I made like a video about that and I was just like guys he like doesn't care like he was literally there like he doesn't mind she's like blah blah blah but that's the only thing that I've like I don't really don't like apologize unless it like I actually do something up and like then I'll obviously apologize for it but if I don't feel like I have to apologize I won't like I'm not gonna like fake an apology yeah a lot of like influencers I know will like make a whole like sappy apology video but they don't mean it like most of the time like I'm not gonna do that yeah I'll normally just be like yeah you guys like whatever I mean she seems pretty unbothered by all the hate she's seen this way the last time that she was called out and I had talked about the time where she was first really really receiving a lot of hate and it was for calling her friends lazy she had posted a tick tock talking about how her friends post on be real which is like an app that a timer goes off like once a day and you're supposed to take a picture of what you're doing it takes a selfie and like a picture of what you're looking at and she says like all her friends were in bed and I mean and people just didn't love what she said does anybody have a job does anyone work I swear to God just be real like I I like get on myself all the time even though I'm the most productive person ever like I'm always doing something I'm never in bed in the middle of the day and then I got be real and this b-roll could go off at 11AM 1pm three it doesn't matter everyone's in bed there's an alarming amount of people every time that be real goes off that are just in bed with the with the shades drawn and it makes me feel so good about myself I'm like why are you in bed seems like nobody wants to work these days apps up and work she was called Al people said how dare she even have the audacity to say people are lazy in bed they're probably just tired because working is hard and she's just a privileged influencer she shouldn't be talking about other people this way and it turned into this whole thing and the worst part was instead of just coming out and like clarifying what she meant or saying sorry she added some more fuel to the fire and said my job isn't easy you guys see LMAO too soon and it's a video of her doing like a tick tock dance she tried to then make videos clarifying that she was only talking about her influencer friends laying around in bed all day and she said that she wasn't talking about random people when she posted that and couldn't believe how big this whole thing had gotten I mean the whole thing really was wild and obviously they hadn't really chilled out since with all this new drama every other week I feel like she's getting called out for something that she's posted on Tick Tock or something that she said but I mean she's just going about her life on father colored and honestly it kind of gives me 10 of Vibes a little bit I'm like this is giving Tana from a few years ago where there's a new thing every single week and she just doesn't really care but either way this whole thing is certainly interesting what's gone on and I want to know what you guys think about all of this so let me know your thoughts in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys 
ad,ad: Google Pixel 7/Pro Review: Hard Problems? Software Answers!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE5H5intsck,0-20,(upbeat music)  All right Pixel 7s 7 and 7 Pro. I've been using these phones for about a week now and yes they are very similar to last year. They're the same prices too. But more than ever this year and you can see it at every corner the Pixel's special is software solutions to hardware problems. And this is in contrast to say the Samsung or the Xiaomi special which is throw as much raw hardware horsepower at the thing as possible. There's just no way that isn't better than before. And there's nothing right or wrong with either of these approaches. Matter of fact as a techhead you can kind of appreciate both. But there is just a little bit of a magic to the software way at least when it works. So yeah I can definitely appreciate the slightly updated hardware on the outside of the Pixel. Because even though it isn't super important to the Google mission it's still important to the users. So initially with my very first handson I didn't love it but it's kind of growing on me. The main change here being the metal camera bar instead of the allglass visor from last year. It lets them do some interesting stuff with the colors but most importantly lets them make it all one piece of metal all the way around with the frame of the rest of the phone. It's polished aluminum on the Pro and matte aluminum on the Pixel 7. Then both phones also get brighter displays up to 1500 nits peak on the 7 Pro and 1400 knits on the regular Pixel 7. Can't fake that with software. And then the 7 Pro display is larger slightly curved over the edges. And a generally betterlooking display with less offaxis rainbowing. But interestingly it's set to 1080p outthebox by default even though it's a 1440p panel. I immediately switch that to 1440 and have had no battery issues. So I recommend doing that. Matter of fact might as well just say it right off the top. I have had great battery experiences with these phones. I've been mostly dailying the 7 Pro. David at the studio's been dailying the 7. And yeah they've been excellent. Like just this morning today drove into the studio had an hourlong commute with Waze on full brightness GPS streaming Spotify audio through Bluetooth to the car. Got here with like 85% battery left. And I'm consistently ending days with 30 to 40%. Six to 7 hours is not a problem. Yeah I've had very good battery life on these phones. Very impressive. That's a combination of software optimization better modems just better chip overall. But speaking of chips inside the phone there are very few new specs but the new second generation Tensor G2 from Google is one of 'em. There's also a little bit extra RAM on the Pro phone. It does benchmark a bit higher than the first Tensor but in terms of raw power it's right in line with the Snapdragon 865 fine. But just like I talked about in the problem with benchmarks video which you can watch here if you haven't seen it already Google is optimizing this Tensor G2 chip to work more efficiently specifically with its AI stuff it's AI magic. So while yeah the G2 is a little faster than the first Tensor with its smaller 4nanometer process node the real improvements are in its machine learning capabilities which are 60% faster and 20% more efficient than last year. So the things that actually require those AI smarts are dramatically better and faster. So that is where it starts to get interesting. Not to dismiss the slight improvements of the Pixel overall. I mean you can see they even they painted inside the port and the speakers down here to match the revs of the phone. It's nice I like it. But that's not what the Pixel is all about. The Pixel is the software. It is the smartest smartphone and pretty much all of the reasons you'd pick a phone like a Pixel 7 over the rest are in the software. Like for phone calls for example Pixel is the only phone with call screening which to me is still super useful but it also goes to another level. So when you call a business that has an automated system the improved Direct my Call feature will surface all the buttons at once so you can press to navigate through an automated system before the robot even finishes saying them. It saves me so much time. I love that. I also like the new home screen search which still has all the great functionality as before it's just cleaner and better designed. And then with the new selfie camera the Pixel has added AIbased face unlock which is great but as you can see it's just a single selfie camera up top here. There's no infrared depth mapping or face ID equivalent. So while it's super fast in great conditions it absolutely struggles as expected when you're in the dark or when you have a mask on. So there's also still an under display fingerprint reader for dual biometric authentication anytime face unlock fails. I will say I was hoping that the fingerprint reader would be one of the things that improved to the Pixel 7 hardwarewise because the one in the 6 was a little bit of a letdown for me. It's not noticeably bigger or faster. It fine it's not terrible. It's just a slight step behind the ultrasonic ones which are noticeably faster than this optical one. Oh also the Recorder app. Most some people don't even care about this but the Recorder app is better. It's already the best in the world at doing incredibly fast and accurate speechtotext. You've seen this before thanks Tensor. But I got an amazing demo of somebody starting a recording and then putting the phone in their pocket and we had a full on conversation. They took the phone out of their pocket and it had perfectly transcribed our entire conversation with speaker labels. So each time the opposite person spoke it labeled that. Incredibly useful or incredibly creepy depending on who you are. But that's one of the features that's allegedly coming later this year to an update. I'm gonna be using that. And it just definitely feels like anywhere you go on this phone Google Assistant is waiting right around the corner waiting to help you out. It was the same with the last Pixel. Android 13 got its improvements with Material You and the under the hood improvements. But just the Google stuff everywhere the routines the little reminders the little chip cards and messages for helpful things you might wanna do to add to a message. There's a lot of good stuff. There's even a new feature called Photo Unblurr. You might have seen the demos. Basically takes any photo in your Pixel 7's library actually anything in your Google Photos library at all. And if it's a little bit blurry you hit that unblur button and it can use AI to identify what the scene should look like and fix the photo remove the blur. Seems super cool. So okay after trying this with a bunch of photos we found that it seems to work best specifically with photos of subjects that are in focus but the exposure time was too long and so now there's a bit of blur in one direction. In that exact instance I found it can do a pretty good job of turning a streaky blurry photo into something much more usable. I wouldn't expect anything magical but you know this is pretty cool. It's the definition of using software to solve hardware problems. Also they do say Pixel 7 exclusive for this feature for now I don't really buy it. They say it's because of Tensor G2. I give it about a year before this feature is available for more phones maybe anyone using Google Photos. But hey for now gotta have the Pixel 7. But the point is Google is not setting out to make a phone with the absolute best hardware and the best display and the absolute best raw performance. I mean if they are they're failing. But Google Pixel is absolutely the smartest smartphone in the room. It's the smartest phone you can get and it's even more true again this year. Now the Pixel has been known for one other thing probably as long as anything else and that's the cameras. And there's an updated suite of cameras on the front and the back of the Pixel 7s this year. So the 50 megapixel primary camera is the same on both same as last year. The Pro gets a new even wider ultrawide with autofocus while the 7 keeps the one from last year. And the Pro also gets a new 5x 48megapixel telephoto camera. And as expected the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro take excellent photos in a variety of different lighting conditions and they have that very distinct Pixel style the high dynamic range contrasty lots of detail those shots. This big sensor can create some pretty nice natural depth of field still without using portrait mode. I love that. I know I shouldn't be super impressed that you know normal daylight photos look great on the Pixel but hey these are really really good. And then the new Pro ultrawide does a really good job with macro photography. Doesn't do macro video but this photo of an ant is really hard to get. And the auto switching to macro mode can be disabled if you're like me and prefer taking close up photos of things with the main camera. Just beware of minimum focus distance. But then here's another great example of solving hardware problems with software. The zoom so the 1x camera still normal 1x. That's a 50megapixel main sensor binning down to 12 megapixels. The 2x button is a 12megapixel crop of the middle of the frame so a high quality zoom. Then from 2x to 5x the camera's actually doing some composition. It's adding detail in the middle of the frame from the telephoto camera and then compositing them together. Then you get to 5X and it's snapping to the full telephoto camera. That makes perfect sense. Then again the 10x is taking a 12megapixel crop of the middle of the telephoto so another high quality zoom. And it's pretty good. I will say it's not quite as good as having a dedicated 10x telephoto camera on the back of the phone. Like having a dedicated camera is always gonna give you the sharper overall image. But for someone like me who only zooms once in a while the whole Super Res Zoom software solution is very passable as you can see and then that saves you money. And then you get the zoom stabilization that activates at 15x and it is really really stable. Maybe a little too stable sometimes because it kind of makes it hard to track moving objects which I know you love to do when you're creeping I mean bird watching. Anyway yeah the Pixel's camera is still top of the heap when it comes to pointandshoot Android cameras. The shutter speed is super fast. So if you're trying to freeze motion and also capture like an exact moment this camera's really good at that. The selfie cameras on both are also improved. It's now an 11megapixel selfie camera. They both do ultrawide selfies now instead of just the Pro. Love that. And video is slightly better too including 10bit HDR. Tough to show that in this SDR video but if you've seen HDR video before you know where this excels already. Anything with bright specular highlights loads of dynamic range et cetera it's still a step behind the iPhone when it comes to noise levels and autofocus. So for those curious why I still put the iPhone as the overall king of smartphone imagery that's why. But this is not far behind by any means. Okay here's a couple other small things that didn't fit into the rest of this review. The speakers on the 7 Pro are slightly louder but slightly less bassey than the 6 Pro just a little tinier. So a little less low end for a little bit more vocal clarity. I found that interesting. And then there's not a whole lot going for sustainability for these phones other than the metal visor and frame being made with 100% recycled materials. Some pretty specific wording there. But also the box it comes in which doesn't have a charger does come with a cable and an adapter and is fully recyclable cardboard. And then a big question are there bugs? Because my Pixel 6 experience was a roller coaster. I mean I loved the phone to start but then it slowly descended into having more and more bugs until it was like unusable to me and I stopped using it. Then it got some updates that squashed those bugs and then I ended up dailying it for like the last two months or so. So are their bugs on the Pixel 7s? Yeah I have found some. I mean I had this media player bug where it just shows a blank space where the media player's supposed to be whether or not there was any media playing. That did go away after reboot. There was also this weird thing where after you hit the X in the Google search bar that button just disappears but it's still pressable for some reason. Also I tried to post the Instagram Story from the Pixel 7 Pro the other day and it just looked like this for some reason. Honestly no idea what happened here. Everyone saw it. Apparently some people thought it was an ad for dbrand's new Digital Camo. It wasn't. But this is. Hey if your new metal bar isn't enough and you want your new Pixel to look even more different from the rest channel sponsor dbrand's new skin is pretty sick and it's a foolproof way to make your phone look unique. Plus it hopes to hide that dust that sort of naturally accumulates right above and below the camera bar. So link below of course. Right below that like button. But I've really enjoyed using the Pixel and that's why it's going in my pocket as my daily driver phone for now anyway. As far as whether you should get one or not I think the real question is how much money are you willing to spend? Because same prices as last year 599 899. And I think my initial feeling is I still feel the same which some people got kind of twisted by the way. But the $300 difference between these phones the Pixel 7 is a way better deal than the 7 Pro. Like they're both wellpriced and they're both very competitive and frankly undercutting most of what they're competing against. But the 7 is just for most people a nobrainer. So this is the phone I'm gonna be recommending more often. Probably a Value Phone of the Year contender. Again look there's a lot of stuff Google didn't do with the Pixels like they didn't do super fast 80watt charging. They didn't do multiple telephoto cameras. It doesn't even fold in half right? There's a lot of stuff. But for patient Pixel people who prefer pristine programming and pretty pictures the Pixel Pro is pretty perfect. (bright music) 
03/04/2023,The Kelly Family is in Big Trouble,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOxB6DKCtKg,107-15,meet the Kelly Family a tick tock family that has over 1 million followers on Tick Tock and has been the center of drama for weeks now parents Ty and Haley found themselves getting called out after a post on Tick Tock where they decide that their son loves to ride thrill rides at theme parks but he just isn't tall enough to ride them all so they decided to make him platform shoes and have him wear them at the park to make sure that he meets the height requirement they were calling this a little parenting hack meet my son Cannon our thrill-seeking boy who can't get enough of Disney theme park rides the only problem you ask he's just not tall enough for the big ones but we didn't want that to stop him from feeling the rush so we took matters into our own hands and crafted a shoe that just might do the trick and when people saw this they were horrified and just calling them out saying how unsafe this is in that there's obviously height requirements in place on rides for a reason upset over the backlash Tai stood his ground and he responded to the comments and people felt gaslit by his words because he claimed the video was not supposed to be taken seriously and it was all jokes and jokes on us because his son is actually tall enough to ride these rides that they went on without the shoes I would never ever ever put my kids in actual danger that's number one number two I would never condone any other parent trying to put their kid on a ride that they're not tall enough or something that's not safe for them that's number two number three you don't actually know what happened in the video you didn't see him going on any rides all you saw was him wearing a platform shoe that made him way over the height of 38 inches you want to know why because he's already tall enough with regular shoes to be 38 inches tall so before you start throwing stones get the facts straight oh and by the way the two thrill rides he rode was Slinky Dog Dash and Smugglers Run he had a really really good chance of falling out of those rides I tell you what people didn't react well to this and said how dare you be misled by my own words parent influencers are so red flag I can't believe you guys had the audacity to assume that what I said in the video was what I meant he's already tall enough created shoes to make him tall I would never put my kid in danger except apparently for Disney ride please did he really just Gaslight us all despite the hate on Tick Tock the Kelly family decided to post this video onto YouTube as well and you can literally see in the YouTube video they're making the shoes they're putting the shoes on their son at the theme park the video was literally titled I made my toddler tall enough for thrill rides at Disney like how am I supposed to know that he wasn't already tall enough that's your title like come on now but unlike what they did on Tick Tock they actually put a little tiny baby disclaimer in the description of this video that said disclaimer this video is not in to be taken seriously as we made this video solely for entertainment purposes do not attempt this yourself Disney is great at their jobs and you will get caught but people were obviously calling him out they were calling him and his wife out at that but especially him because he's the one that was responding on Tick Tock and responding to all the haters people had so much to say they were tagging Disney trying to get them banned from the parks forever for doing this and he was holding his ground except unlike his defense on Tick Tock where he said my son was tall enough he actually went in the Commons and was like my son had a great day that's all that matters someone commented great parenting teaching kids rules don't have to apply to them and aren't implemented for safety and they said my kids just going to remember having the time of his life at Disney someone all said pretty sure those shoes aren't going to hold him in the seat in the event of an unfortunate incident this is like thinking platform shoes and weight belts can make your kids safe in the car without a car seat that is not how it works they reply arcade is nearly 40 pounds he's plenty heavy enough for Slinky Dog Dash and this made me laugh because you'd think that with this response the Slinky Dog Dash would be like the teacups or something when it's actually this ride like I feel like you would have to be the height requirement to ride this roller coaster I don't care if it's a little baby roller coaster to everybody else in your eyes I just see like why risk it why would you risk it you know like in a year or two like he'll be tall enough you know but anyways someone else decided to call them out for not taking accountability for having done this and encouraged others to do the same saying why is it so hard for you guys to admit you made a wrong decision and apologized instead y'all hear trying hards to justify it I guess it's true money is a lot more important for y'all and they replied no money involved just know what we did wasn't a big deal like y'all are making it out to be so clearly he's saying that is not a big deal like he does not think that this is a big deal what their video is so Tai ended up making another apology video on Tick Tock and instead of gaslighting people he actually did say that he was sorry about all of this hey everyone so it's been a crazy last few days and we've been getting a lot of negative publicity over the last few days and over the over a few of the videos that we posted and honestly I just wanted to address all of you I just wanted every single one of you to hear me say that I'm a very much flawed individual I have lots of problems many of you have pointed those out if we were making so much money off of social media then I wouldn't have to work a full-time job and my wife wouldn't have to work her job so we're not making a lot of money not much at all off of social media I would have already removed that video if I thought it was wrong the one thing that I do want to apologize for is all the people that actually stood up for us and tried to you know protect us or vouch for us and then you got attacked because of us I want to apologize for that and I'm really really sorry that that happened to you and I could have handled certain parts of this situation better and I'll be the first one to say that so um I'm sorry that I didn't handle this the perfect way however I'm not going to take the video down no they did end up removing all the videos though and seemingly understanding what the issue was and him and his wife did sit down to film a video for Youtube and Tick Tock apologizing together hey everyone so we'd like to address this Disney shoe situation one more time so what started off as us trying to make an entertaining video for our audience that we thought you'd enjoy quickly turned into US realizing that what we put out on our platforms has more consequences than we initially thought we have more influence than we initially thought and that influence if presented in a negative way could have a ripple effect that could potentially cause harm or danger to someone else Although our son was unharmed and completely okay we do now understand that that may not be the case for some other kid and the last thing that we'd want to happen from something that we put out on our social media is for someone to get hurt in light of this realization we've decided to take all the videos down related to this content we hope that you'll give us the opportunity to prove that we love our children we love you all we love each other and that with influence comes responsibility and we take that seriously but after this things kinda get weird because the drama didn't stop there Tai actually went on live almost every single day since this whole situation started to respond to haters I don't mind blocking you I don't mind blocking you at all because what wouldn't you do for your Tick Tock Fame what kind of question is that my first mistake was making kids okay I disagree with you 100 percent like intensely reading the chat and talking to people about this still been watching this and people are literally crazy it just scares me for you uh look it's all right it's all right God's gonna take care of us um God knows our heart and he knows what's up and all these people that are making judgments they can they can make judgments and we tried to own up for the part that we felt like we did wrong and that's why we uh you know took down stuff and um the other stuff is it's gonna be okay gonna be all right it kind of reminded me of the video where Gabby Hannah was on live like typing just like so invested in the comments and the original video was posted weeks ago you guys but literally a couple days ago I was scrolling on Tick Tock and there's Ty and someone had said that they were actually a wife of an employee that works at a theme park and she accepts his apology and boy did he run with us I appreciate the apology as the wife of a cast member at Hollywood Studios Savannah hey Savannah I just want to say something hey Savannah um question you don't have to you really really don't have to but um I would love to chat with you for a second um I don't know if you can uh request to to be a guest on here but I'd love to just chat with you just for a moment hey he wanted her to come and join the live and I believe he really wanted her to join to be like look someone who knows somebody that works at Disneyland doesn't think I'm a horrible person and I think he really wanted to show the haters like look like I'm not I'm not bad I'm not bad but this it really didn't end up being how he wanted it to go that is for sure so she joined the live and she talked about how hard it is to be a cast member and she really wanted to tell him that along with his apology if he really wanted to use his platform for good he should advocate for cast member raises and you could tell he was like yeah that's not what I wanted you to say but good for her like she got on that live and she was advocating for her husband who works at the park and she was advocating for raises because truly minimum wage does not cut it for what they're dealing with every single day at those parks and I know a lot of people that have worked at both Disney and Universal that did not get paid enough for how chipper they need to be at work that is for sure but despite this little interaction that he had that did not really go his way and he didn't really get that like Fu to the haters that I think he really wanted he's still been going live so it doesn't seem like he's ready to let the conversation about all of this go and I don't really think that that's like healthy like to be arguing with the haters like in the comments on live like every single day but as of right now that's what's been said by them and what people have had to say in reaction to their post I had no idea who this family was before all of this but once I heard what was going on and I saw their response I was like was I just Gaslight by a Family Channel like I I really wanted to talk about with you guys because I just could not believe what was going on but let me know your thoughts and if you guys have seen this family on Tick Tock or if you guys have heard about the situation let me know in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys [Music] foreign 
01/09/2023,Danielle Cohn BULLIED For Going Back to her Ex Ethan Fair..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAGG6-XDr1Q,88-10,the entire internet is going after Danielle Cohen for not only rekindling her friendship with her ex Ethan fair but also for defending him after he did her dirty this is going to be very aside from Daniel Cohen receiving tons of hate this week well Bryce Hall also decided to join Danielle and embarrass himself in front of the entire internet after he got into a fight with multiple security guards in Vegas and y'all even Mala trevejo got exposed by her ex-staffers for being racist and abusive and they're now seeking over 4 million dollars in Damages as you can see a lot has gone down in the last couple of days so with that being said let's just go ahead straight to our first drama from where do I even start you guys I was literally talking about Danielle's stupid drama with her ex Mason a couple of weeks ago and now she's in big trouble over her ex Ethan fair if you guys didn't already know Danielle broke up with her recent ex Mason a couple of months ago after she announced it on her Instagram story this situation escalated quickly after the pair got into an argument online to which an unknown girl stepped in and revealed that Mason did in fact cheat on Danielle with her of course Mason kept denying this accusation while trying to gain Danielle's trust again but from Danielle's responses she seems that she was completely over him as if she had moved on already from the situation a couple of weeks later Mason tried getting Danielle's attention Again by posting about her constantly and pretending that they had never broken up but unfortunately the man got bored to the point where he switched on Danielle out of the blue and liked a very shady comment towards her after he posted a video with a new girl not him pretending that he wasn't crying and throwing up over Danny anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this cute little update because we're about to get into some serious stuff right now if you guys didn't know one of Danielle's exes that had a huge impact on Danny's life aside from mikitua was Ethan Fair Ethan fair was a normal tick tocker who had a couple thousand followers on social media before he blew up and he somehow managed to pull Danielle after they began teasing each other on the internet months later the couple announced their relationship and started creating content with each other for their fans but for some reason the couple didn't last too long after they broke up four months into their relationship for for unknown reasons so yes me and Danny did break up but I just wanted to say that it's all good vibes she was an amazing girlfriend I really did love her and I really do wish the best for her and everyone else this started a huge speculation in The Tick Tock Community about their relationship and whether Ethan fair was using Danielle for clout this entire time or not that was until Danielle cleared up the rumors months later where she revealed in a YouTube video that she had an abortion after an audio conversation got leaked to the public and while she opened up in the video about the struggles she faced and how it came as a complete shock when she found out other than that she also revealed that she had to go through it without any support at all after her boyfriend left her alone during the pregnancy first third thought in my head was let me call the person who I was with that night and tell him and and let's just say I went through it alone and that was the hardest part because people immediately knew that Danielle was talking about her ex Ethan in the video since she was quick enough to defend Mikey by saying that it wasn't him while Ethan on the other hand had to hand his comments to avoid people asking him questions three years after this situation went down with people still holding grudges against Ethan Danielle decided to link up with her ex Ethan after she got a commercial for her body care brand and y'all the entire internet went in shambles afterwards since they didn't expect Danielle to rekindle her friendship with Ethan especially after what he did to her and the Damage he caused her in the past after the whole pregnancy thing she goes back she always goes back after all he put her through a damn shame after tons of people dragged Danielle for embarrassing herself again by rekindling her friendship with Ethan Danielle decided to release a statement afterwards talking about the situation where she claimed that they're both friends now and are on good terms and that they both handled the situation wrong in the past and they regret putting each other in danger even though not that many people agreed with Danielle's decision it seems that her ex Mason was very supportive of Dany after he stepped in for the picture of Danny and Ethan with a comment saying his obsession with Danielle is seriously unreal anyways y'all let's move on now to the one and only Bryce Hall who not only got into a fight with multiple security guards but also got charged with two battery misdemeanors damn how many times did this man get into a fight with the security guards throughout this entire decade I'm genuinely so sick and tired of him not gonna lie you guys my life has been so great ever since I stopped talking about Bryce Hall in my videos I mean this man was literally causing chaos in The Tick Tock Community for years and despite some of them genuinely being so entertaining he did end up ruining his reputation over and over again just like he did back in 2017 at his Peak back in 2020 Bryce got into multiple public fights with security guards restaurant employees and even regular people and of course we all know know how that went since some of them tried filing a lawsuit against Bryce While others accused him of saying slurs and we all know how that went down at that time oh it just seemed that Bryce didn't care about his image he was putting of himself to the media and just from these videos alone you can tell the type of person he is forward to this here you guys we expected things to change with price but unfortunately this man just keeps getting worse and worse after he recently got into a serious fight in Las Vegas this week where he attempted to fight two security guards for kicking him out of a nightclub okay hey he's not a fighter he never claimed to be yeah this wasn't some type of high school publicity stunt type of fight because according to TMZ the person who videotaped the entire fight Bryce allegedly got charged with two battery misdemeanors over the fight that he had with the security guards and from what we've seen Bryce has neither addressed the situation publicly nor been active on social media ever since the fight went down Bryce was finally becoming funny and not annoying then he goes and does this he'll never change always fighting somebody alcohol ain't your friend Bryce the way he is gonna make tick tocks about this and get millions of likes because that's what his fans like to watch please lock him up forever speaking of Bryce getting sued let's just end today's video with Mala trevejo also getting sued by ex-staffers for abusive and racist treatment it hasn't even been a couple of days since we talked about Mal trevejo and here she is getting exposed and sued by her ex-staffers for being racist and abusive I love how the tables turn sometimes if you guys have missed my previous videos on Malo trevejo well unfortunately this girl had some serious words to say on the internet last week after she got called out for lip syncing the n-word in her recent Tick Tock video and instead of mallow apologizing for offending the entire black community she went on a rant instead talking about how she's more Egyptian than Latino which excuses her from saying the n-word Egyptian that makes so much sense right now alive are you [ __ ] were providing me for saying that word in this whole time I'm learning more black than what I am Spanish it's crazy other than this she even posted the DNA test that she received to prove to people that she's more Egyptian I don't understand the type of clownery she was trying to pull us on but thankfully Karma hit her hard this week after Rolling Stone released an article talking about how malu's ex-staffers are suing her for abusive treatment the article went on to expose mallow for her rude Behavior towards her staff after they claimed that she was using her position of power to inflict emotional mental and verbal abuse upon her staff and this info came according to a new civil lawsuit filed in Miami against Mal trevejo and her company in addition to this the former employees who are seeking at least 4 million in Damages are also suing mallow for battery defamation and sexual misconduct among other complaints this is what the ex-staffers revealed in their lawsuit one major complaint in the lawsuit centers around trevejo's alleged emotional and verbal abuse of her employees if her team didn't respond to her texts and calls quickly enough including frequent in middle of the night calls or adequately anticipate her needs trevejo became livid at these perceived failures the former staffers claim she'd allegedly lash out calling them stupid dumb and use racial and homophobic slurs of course an attorney for Malo denied the allegations immediately in a statement to Rolling Stones saying that Malu is aware of the false allegations in the lawsuit and she's looking forward to defending herself against these baseless claims but the media had different opinions on the situation and well just take a look at what some had to say about it this girl been getting away with this for so long and people really think she's innocent I hope the ex-staffers get their Justice for real one thing about Karma it will always get you when you least expect it makes sense now why she had that breakdown on live after being robbed and blackmailed it probably had something to do with this lawsuit Gurley knew her downfall was coming anyways loves if you need more juicy videos on these influencers then don't forget to click on the tab right above 
01/09/2023,TikToker WASTE Food For Money & Views..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plse26qEwes,83-11,spaghetti spaghetti sauce meatballs I hate people that waste food why do you have to waste food on Tick Tock no thanks a little bit it's like the more food you waste the more views it gets why it's not funny you're just being completely wasteful we all know that there are tons of people who spend their entire lives dreaming of becoming famous it sometimes even gets to the point where views and follows become an addiction that fuels the drive to keep making content a lot of these people fall into this problem because they want their talents and passions to be admired and appreciated whether they're an aspiring pop star or a super talented artist or just a content creator millions of people constantly strive to just have that one video go viral which would make them an overnight sensation but not every one of these people are actually talented in fact there are so many wannabe influencers who do some of the most outrageous stuff just to get attention from licking toilet seats to faking entire diseases but one of the most popular methods used by such people is wasting food in today's video I'm going to be showing you guys two content creators who manage to make some of the most obnoxious blood boiling content that I have ever seen literally the trend of wasting food was made big by a tick-tocker called wassail who would create content about how much he loved food except most people expressed their love for food by making videos documenting what they eat in a day or by showing themselves cooking mouth-watering meals wasil on the other hand expressed his love by making content like this I don't even get what he's trying to do however while Sil is really the first person to gain attention for wasting food but there is another tick tocker who has taken this trend to a whole nother level and that is topper Guild here is just one example of the videos that topper Guild has made topper Guild not only wastes food but also a huge amount of money I mean you guys can all see that there is a brand new looking iPhone just sitting on his kitchen counter that he didn't think for one second to maybe move it before it got completely drenched in soy sauce the craziest part about this though to me is that sometimes he actually tries to turn his videos into some sort of attempt at comedy but like I can't imagine how anyone would find this funny seriously though imagine living in poverty and you go into your local Costco to try and find something super cheap so that you can have something to eat for the day and then you see this guy in another aisle with a cart that is literally just full of milk soy sauce and whatever else now imagine going home and logging into Tick Tock to try and escape from reality and then this same guy comes up on your for you page flooding his entire kitchen with an amount of food that could feed an entire town but he doesn't even take more than one bite the worst part about this though is that somehow topper Guild has not won not two but 30 million people who have for some reason found his content entertaining enough to follow him on top of making super cringe content and wasting an extraordinary amount of food topper is also known for basically being one of the biggest cloud chasers on Tick Tock and he does this by directly stealing content from other creators I mean he literally got the idea of wasting food from Marcel who I mentioned earlier and to make matters worse you can tell completely that he got the idea from wisselle because he makes fun out of his accent birthday however this is where things start to take an interesting turn as recently topper has made a dramatic shift in his content that had shocked a ton of people but let's be honest some people on the internet are extremely gullible and I think topper knows that basically for some context around a year ago was still decided to make a big change to the kind of content he was making if you scroll down to the bottom of his account you'll see the usual over-the-top videos of him wasting ingredients to make a 15 second video however if you scroll up to the top of his page you'll see his most recent videos are of him trying out viral Tick-Tock hacks and overall content that is slightly less boring but a whole lot less wasteful and annoying but what prompted was still to make this Sudden Change well he basically got an overwhelming amount of hate the backlash got so bad that he made an apology video explaining that because he now has a large following he no longer wants to make content that could spread a harmful message but now I realize that I have a very big audience and anything that I can record on camera kind of have consequences as far as uh the messaging that I'm putting out there and I just want to say that this video is in no way an excuse for any of my actions that I put out this is simply to say that I was wrong and that I'm sorry I mean it's cool that he became self-aware and apologized for his actions or whatever but like at the same time the only reason he got his platform in the first place was because he took advantage of people online who somehow found his content entertaining so you might be wondering what this has to do with topper Guild well as I mentioned before topper doesn't seem to have a single creative or original bone in his body and when he saw that his biggest inspiration had switched things up topper decided to do the same a tick tocker called Milad went viral for making videos in response to topper in which he would show a clip of topper making his usual food wasting content and then Milad would show himself buying a ton of food but instead of being a complete idiot he would hand out his meals for free to local homeless people just take a look [Music] foreign [Music] this is such a great way to make content that is both engaging and also super beneficial to the lives of others it also pulls in millions of views which is exactly why toppergill decided to copy milad's content as soon as he saw how popular it was getting when I say copying I don't just mean he took the concept of handing out food to homeless people I mean he literally copies pretty much every single scene and uses the exact same audio [Music] man cause sometimes [Music] when people watched Topper's new video they were literally shocked and he received a ton of Praise in his comments by verified creators for finally making a change one Creator wrote thanks for being you bro maybe these other creators can take notes and another user put finally you learned it's great that he's doing something good for other people even if he does it while a man stands behind him recording people that probably don't want to be filmed but saying that he's learned his lesson or that he's changed is a bit of a reach and I'm so happy that I'm not the only one that noticed how obvious it was that topper had seen his views going down while my Lads were going up and decided to piggyback off of his content to keep himself somehow relevant bro this makes more views changed because he understood it's not trending anymore and people are hating on him and he's getting no views some people have made the argument that even if topper is just making the videos because they get him more views at least he's making a positive impact on people's lives and while I agree that it's a much better decision to feed the Homeless than to cover your kitchen Florence cereal I don't think topper should be redeemed from his past just because he gave out a couple of sandwiches there are thousands of Charities that provide free meals for homeless people every single day that don't need to carry around cameras to film their interactions to make themselves look good online what do you guys think do you feel like topper has changed or is he just another Tick-Tock clout Chaser let me know and I'll see you all in my next video [Music]  
01/07/2023,The ’Childish’ TikToker Who Got Cancelled For Being Annoying,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOVm5HeBqec,76-11,imagine being so hated on Tick Tock that there is literally a petition to get you banned off of the platform there are some incredibly valid reasons why certain influencers and public figures have been the subjects of a hate campaign on the most viral social media app in the world for example we just saw a few months ago how Andrew Tate became one of the most talked about people in the world for sharing his misogynistic views and spreading it to his young fans and then getting banned from the entire internet and we have also seen it with world leaders like Donald Trump who have been taken off of social media for a long list of terrible posts however never in my life have I seen someone be so unbelievably hated on Tick Tock simply for being kinda cringe but that's what happened to The Tick Tock user fuzz99 So today we're going to be taking a look at what exactly they did that got so many people mad and how something simple turned into something sinister fuzz 99 also known as mole created their Tick Tock account all the way back in the beginning of 2020 and for the most part they just blended into the millions of other creators that were struggling to get noticed on the app that was until around September of this year when moles started getting a massive amount of hate comments on their videos which led to them turning their comments off and honestly I don't blame them because the comment...

08/16/2022,The Pink Sauce Tiktok Scam That EVERYONE Fell For…,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDKxjwaEGJo,13-15,in the last few months tick tock has started up a new feature on the social media platform called tick-tock shop which as the name suggests creates a digital marketplace where vendors can sell their products directly through social media this feature has literally taken tick tock from being a kid's dancing app to basically being a telemarketing company since users can find a product and link it in their video telling all of their followers to buy it which is heavily encouraged through the tick tock app paying these people a small amount of commission if someone buys a product through their link the tick tock shop is probably one of the most polarizing ventures that i have ever seen a social media platform take since you can actually find some amazing deals such as discounted cosmetics and skincare products but then there are also some things that make me really question the thought process of some of the vendors as on the other side of things you can also buy things like an entire rotisserie chicken and extremely cheap energy drinks and in today's video we're going to be talking about one of the most controversial products that has been sold through tick tock it has captured the attention of thousands of people but for all the wrong reasons so without further ado let's take a look into the pink sauce controversy so upon hearing the name above you probably have no idea what the pink sauce could be apart from obviously a sauce that resembles the color of unicorns and...
