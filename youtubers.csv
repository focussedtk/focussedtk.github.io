07/10/2023,What Happened To SIS vs Bro? (Update),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPdn7nsa74c,162-11, never in a million years would I ever have imagined that sis vs bro would make it to the list of YouTubers that we forgot about and I know for sure that y'all feel the same way since they were this charismatic pair of siblings whose childhood was nothing but thrilling Adventures shared laughter and endless memories for their devoted fans [Music] no wonder people still ask them if they'll ever post videos on their sis vs bro YouTube channel since their last upload two years ago sis vs bro used to be my favorite YouTuber I feel like it was just a couple of days ago I found their Channel and was hooked anyways like they say change is inevitable it's clear that they are now following their own individual paths and they aren't doing badly loves to be honest y'all I don't think people have an issue with this because they weren't going to be kids forever it seems somewhat awkward that they just suddenly stopped posting of course they now have their individual channels but they've never been seen in a video together in two years they are no longer the 9 and 11 year old kids they were in 2016. Ronald seems rather laid back but Karina on the other hand not so much and y'all things are thick on her Tick Tock in addition to these posts about her and her parents rocky relationship there's no abuse going on we're all we're a happy family it's always funny when I see circulation sometimes I see something pop up like how we get abused no we're all happy we're all uh normal people you know at this point it literally feels as though Tick Tock has some kind of Feud with her her first account was doing so well with over a million followers but it got banned she has since created multiple new tick tock accounts but they all just get banned and I'm sure this all took a toll on her because she has to start from scratch every single time from reposting her old videos creating new content trying to get her fans and having to explain things over and over again hoping to reach a million followers again but why is she getting banned so often is she violating The Tick Tock rules or something first of all Karina always has so much to say concerning her childhood having to be a child and a YouTuber she seems to give this vibe that things were not always as rosy as they seemed in those edited videos they put out in one of her tick tocks Karina expressed how she couldn't have a normal childhood or hang out with her friends because she had to film videos for sis versus bro some fans sympathize with her defending her and acknowledging the sacrifices she made for her YouTube channel it's so sad to see that she had to miss out on a lot just to entertain us and you can always tell that Karina seems to Harbor feelings of guilt and resentment towards her childhood and sis vs bro even though fancier is a cherished part of their own childhoods what was the point of it if all of these videos were not genuine shortly after they stopped posting on YouTube Karina took to her first Tick-Tock account and y'all know how vividly different she was both in person and the content she was putting out it changed well I mean people do change like uh not everybody's gonna be wearing diapers forever so people change is that like upsetting should I still be wearing diapers she seemed really scornful about everything she did as a kid and every reaction video she made was not so positive and loves that's not all it also looks like things aren't great between her and her parents in one of her videos she kind of leaked that she and her dad always just end up screaming at each other whenever they have an argument on top of the flawed relationship with her parents it looks like Karina is having trouble in school too in one of her tick tocks she talked about being expelled from her school she then proceeded to Snapchat where she explained the cause of the expulsion was getting high in the bathroom when Ronald did a reaction video on what happened to Sis vs bro he confirmed that for the most part they weren't always as tight as they presented themselves for us and that they never even used to spend time together that much Ronald made a couple more revelations in that reaction video guys they did not even have a say on what or when to shoot videos it was always their parents idea Karina and Ronald just showed up to act when the camera started rolling and we were now we were just like okay video time what's the video like we didn't even make the video ideas we didn't added videos we didn't make the video ideas we didn't like set anything up we just kind of we're there like hey guys sisters bro and yeah it's not like the bond crushed the thing and I also saw this one Tick Tock like this one video where everyone's like my sister said she was like making some video for me if you're like her own personal Channel she was like I don't want to bring the camera downstairs because that's awkward and everyone's like oh my God it's awkward now that's so sad but we weren't recording like when we were making the videos that our parents were recording us or they're like telling us what to say and we were holding the camera and they were right there like you know this is a very disturbing Trend among kids being forced by their parents to be YouTubers most parents motivation is always money but this isn't always a reason to blast their kids life online in the case of sis vs bro for example they were already in a financially stable family well I agree that YouTube made them great money I also don't think that they desperately needed it as if their lives depended on it but if you're gonna walk down and parents didn't tell you to record and you weren't recording because they and like they aren't telling you what to say or anything like yeah it's gonna be awkward it would even be awkward like back in those days and this thing refuses to do anything with you like that's stretched out like I love interesting how he just took this and thought like we don't make videos anymore because I refuse to do anything with her anyways Katrina doesn't seem to agree because why would she make a tick tock video saying she used to pay her parents bills and yet in another separate video she said that she only had 12 euros and 40 cents to her name for a kid who used to be spoiled with everything she wanted just to make videos she is obviously mad at her parents for not putting enough money in her account especially now that she's a bit older let's just hope that they've chosen to hold the money safely in a trust somewhere and that they will transfer her rightful dues to her when she becomes mature enough to make sound financial decisions but guys let's consider her age despite the numerous scandals surrounding Katrina it's important to consider the possibility that she is simply going through a rebellious phase probably this is just a phase that shall pass some fans seem to agree with me on this one said she's just a normal teenager but because her whole life is on the internet everything is blown out of proportion and made a bigger deal than it is I'm actually glad that she got older and got more Rebel Yes she'll grow out of it and then she'll be so much happier will they ever come back to Sis versus bro we can only hope so but for now they've made it clear that they will not because they've grown to be completely different as individuals and they really don't have to do videos together if they don't want to we did love them but we also loved their authentic fun energy I'm a different person from Ronald's my life isn't completely intertwined with Ronald is doing his own thing why I don't know okay we're not twins or something anyways loves I would love to hear your opinion on this situation down below also don't forget to click on the top above for more videos on these celebrities and influencers

07/08/2023,The CREEPY Details You Missed in Colleen Ballinger's Apology Song,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7BX3A1f8KA,159-11,the infamous YouTuber Colleen Ballingeris back and against better judgment shehas decided to shock us with one hell ofa half-hearted apology that will leaveyou both speechless or matter at herthan before guys the drama is at anall-time high just as the vileaccusations that were leveled againsther but that's not all her ex-husbandJoshua David mostly referred to as Joshhas also had his two sons to say on thisissue I didn't think I'd be talkingabout Colleen Ballinger ever again but Ipromise y'all this is a big one sowithout a bee let's get right into itloves for those who are blissfullyunaware and the ones who had forgottenabout her Colleen Ballinger hasjaw-dropping allegations about groomingher underage fans in the past few yearsshe never really officially came out tooffer any explanations or apology butguess what while we assumed that maybeshe decided to deal with this underwraps for summer reason Colleen decidedto speak about it in a video sheuploaded a few days ago and loves when Itell you that this is one for the booksliterally Hall of Fame material anddon't get it twisted it's nothing tosmile about she not only dropped a songbut accompanied it with a ukulelebecause in her wise thinking thisapology needed a tune and beats yeahclassic okay before we dive into thelyrics and what her ex-husband had tosay can we for a minute talk about herthought process for this whole 10 minutevideo I don't know about y'all but Iwould think that if you've been accusedof a crime that outrageous where minersare involved and there's evidence andyou took ages before responding I'dassume that you were thinking of thebest approach to clear your name and betruly remorseful because at the end ofthe day you do owe your fans anexplanation so forgive me for thinkingthat Colleen would actually takeaccountability for this when I tell youthat I was beyond shocked when I watchedthis video for her it was just one thosefun light-hearted videos that MirandaSings does and I'm not the only one whothought this was a complete jokehonestly my main criticism with this isthat she didn't actually address whatshe did and what parts are rumors I doagree with some of the things she saidmainly about cancel culture rippingpeople to shreds I just wish she hadgone about this a little differentlysince ukulele seems very insensitivehopefully she can put out anotherstatement and an actual apology and Ihope she can learn and grow from this Iactually can't believe this is real thesad thing is is that it's clear that sheput a bunch of effort into the song andanother fan said this is so insulting tothe victims this in my opinion is thegoat of bad apologies safe to sayColleen Ballinger has thrown her careerto the pitstrain[Music]Trace information[Music]but guys let's give it to her it's notevery day that we see a ukulele apologyyeah brand If This Were me this wouldhave been the best time to hire a PRmanager not to turn into a recordingartist well I have to hand it to herthis is the most original apology videoI've ever seen I guess she gets pointsfor creativity now can we talk about thelyrics of this masterpiece of hersbecause she did acknowledge that theallegations were actually true[Music]okay first of all in this short-livedsongwriting career of hers Colleen wasso determined to shoot herself in thefoot now imagine being accused of havinginappropriate interactions with yourfans and then you go ahead and use thewords manipulation in a response videoin addition to that there is enoughevidence actual messages from her tothese fans and yet she has the nerve tosay these are just misinformation frommanipulation station woo girl okaymoving on swiftly loves there areobviously different perspectives hereeven these messages about periodsvirginity and everything she wasdiscussing with these minors were out ofgenuine concern she has no right to comeon here all dolled up with vocal checksand musical instruments trying to paintherself as innocent when she was theadult in all these cases and whateverher side of the story is these kidsfeelings still matter as long as herinteractions affected them which is afact and that's why they're stilltalking about it what she's saying nowis that she's being bullied and canceledand that things are being taken out ofcontext book gloves some people feel thesame way too she yo-yoed between this ismisinformation none of it is true andI'm only human don't judge me for amistake so wildly my eyes crossed toyour miners if your weird eye asks youyour favorite positions or to spreadyour legs with the excuse of a fart jokeplease tell your parents about it herbehavior wouldn't be K as a familymember either so it goes without sayingthat Colleen Ballinger's apology didn'tserve its purpose it actually angeredfans and triggered many you can clearlysee that according to her she didnothing wrong she was just trying to bebesties with everybody during her earlycareer days and instead of takingaccountability for her vile Behavior heronly regret is that she shouldn't havemessaged or responded to fans as if fansdon't interact as celebrities andinfluencers every daymany years ago I used to message my fansbut not in a creepy way like a lot ofyou are trying to suggest it was more ofa loser kind of way[Music]other than not taking accountabilityshe's even opened herself up to morehate most people obviously had forgottenabout this incident While othersprobably didn't even know about her butnow she has made us relive these momentsand her tragic story has hit theheadlines and Colleen is once again thetalk of the internet and not in a goodway maybe she's enjoying this what ifshe decided to come out with the songand let the internet do its thing butsomeone significantly important to thestory has also spoken up Joshua EvansColleen's ex-husband he took to Twitterto talk about the matter and even gaveus more insight into who Colleen reallyis in real life anyone feeling hurt andgaslit right now my message to you isthis your experiences were real theproof is there your trauma should betaken seriously the proof is there youranger is Justified the proof is thereyou deserve better take your power backsending you love this Behavior was myreality anytime I spoke up and disagreedwith her actions and rhetoric during the2009-2016I was gaslit too I was made to feel likeI was always the problem any pain I feltwas an inconvenience and was belittledevery ounce of what you're feeling Iunderstand and in another follow-uptweet he wrote I have no desire to usethis as a catalyst for YouTube comebackit's not a safe place for me I'm pastthat my voice is only here to helpvalidate those that are hurting nothingmore I have no need to make money off ofthis that is gross and not in my headwhatsoever since they were together forseven years and married over one year wecan't disregard everything he says heundoubtedly knows Colleen better thanany of us let me bring you up to speedabout how Josh did the most in the nameof being an online mentor to oneteenager called Johnny they met in 2018during Colleen's bus tour Ashley wasthrough Johnny that we first caught awindow of who Colleen really was herevealed that working with the couplewas a nightmare and that they had to putup with Colleen's constant bullyingamong other unpleasant experiences hehas since moved on from all of that buthe openly spoke about how much self-workit took to get over Colleen Johnny alsomade a separate video documenting hisexperience with Josh it seemed like bothColleen and Josh had questionablerelationships with fans because Josheven went ahead to give Johnny hisnumber and tried to be too close to himafter that in his defense Josh said thathe was only trying to be a mentor whichin retrospect wasn't appropriateconsidering that Johnny was only ateenager when they met of course it didraise eyebrows while a grown-up would beso obsessed with hanging out with ateenager that much why was Josh giving akid his number and why did he make it apoint to enthusiastically invite him tomore events and even do YouTube videocollabs with a child because that is howgroomers start Josh later ghosted Johnnyduring his divorce from Colleen he onlycame out to address his seeminglyquestionable closeness with Johnny whenJohnny started making the expose videosabout the couple he apologized forbefriending Johnny and tookaccountability for the fact that Johnnywas still a kid back then so as theadult he was supposed to have boundaryJosh made a long tweet apologizing forthe whole situation before eventuallyleaving YouTube he took the blame forgiving young Johnny his number askinghim to tweet on his Sarah account andnot taking him seriously he went as faras admitting that his life was toxic andchaotic at the time and finally wishedJohnny the very best in life what wereColleen and the husband up to but yousee guys that's the thing they say theinternet never forgets so when Colleendecides to annoy people with this basicwashed out disingenuous apology she alsoopened the Pandora's Box and when herex-husband tweeted about it he also tookus back to where it all started so it'sinexcusable for her to come out heredismissing the miners she groomed in asong saying it's a misunderstanding whenshe clearly knew what she was doing andwas even called out for this you canunderstand why her little Sideshow was avery bad idea and one last thing loveswhy would Colleen care enough to write asong If all of these were false let meknow your thoughts in the commentsection

automatically turns aroundand turns it into somethingor suggestive clearly she wasuncomfortable and the fact that Colleenwas even bringing up a topic like thisto a child is a vile and sickening whenthis Tick Tock video was going aroundlots of people in the comment sectionwere praising JoJo siwa for the way shehandled the awkward situation that sheunfortunately had to undergo at the agethat she was there is also this otherclip that I really want to show you guyswhere Colleen is playing a game of neverhave I ever with Jojo and many of theprompts revolved around kissingboyfriends crushes

sueyou well you want to look at my pantiesnonext question thank you I have beenseeing a lot of comments of peoplecoming forward as to why all thisinformation about Colleen is just nowcoming out and a lot of people are justtheorizing that at the time Colleen madeall of these things out to be somethingthat was deemed normal to all thesechildren and of course children beingchildren wouldn't really think twiceabout the topics they were presented andthe environment that they weresurrounded in I mean at the end of theday they were going to all these showsbecause they liked Miranda as a fan andthese children were just vulnerable theyweren't thinking about the deeper anddarker side of Colleen people haven'tseen things like this over on Tick Tockshe normalizes that kind of languagewhich is harder for a child out todiscern when a person with badintentions does it character or not actor not this was still a grown adultthinking and acting out these things allthose parents no one stopped itquestioned it or anything I did see thiscomment that talked specifically aboutthe shows that all these children wereattending one person commented how therewas no advertising for Miranda's showsallowing them to be PG-13 there was noadvertising for her being PG-13 andmeant for kids so if you went andordered tickets there's nothing PG-13saying or parental advisory which ifthat's true that could make sense as towhy these parents were unaware aboutwhat these children were being presentedwith at these Miranda Sings shows and isso wrong on Colleen's part parentsshould have consent and know what theirchildren are being fed with andsurrounded with anyways guys this hasbeen the ongoing stuff that has beencoming out about Colleen Ballinger as ofrecently I definitely want to know whatyou guys think about these recent clipsof not only her performance but alsowhere it seems like she's doingblackface but also the interactions withher and JoJo it's honestly just trulydisgusting and

have beencoming out about her over these past fewweeks this isn't your typical YouTuberapology video though because Colleenmore so is denying most of theallegations that have come out about herand she's doing it by singing in aukulele people are just confused andthey're calling her out for thisresponse video and they're just sayingthis was not it they're coming for herPR team as well and they're just askingColleen why she thought this was a goodidea to make as a response video amidallegations of inappropriate conductinvolving some of her young fans Colleena 36 year old YouTuber known as MirandaSings has been facing severe backlashover these past few weeks she's evenbeen losing sponsors due to everythingcoming out about her after initiallysurfacing in 2020 the accusationsagainst Colleen resurfaced in June ofthis year when Adam McIntyre a formerfan of Colleen brought to life allegedinappropriate conversations he had withthe YouTuber this happened when he was14 years old in an expose video Adammade allegations that Colleen hadallegedly engaged in bullying andmanipulating her fans coercing them intoproviding unpaid labor as well as someother abhorrent things there were alsovideos on top of videos coming out aboutColleen's behavior during her MirandaSings shows which people were justshocked to see people have since beenwaiting for Colleen's response or howshe was going to address the situationas the days were going by and hersilence was speaking wonders to a lot ofpeople as a consequence of theseaccusations Colleen has faced severalcriticism from all directions she's beenlosing subscribers followers and thingswere only getting worse for her as thedays were going by until today Colleendecided to upload a video titled hi itwas a 10 minute video and she was prettymuch singing with a ukulele trying toexpress herself for all the wrongdoingsof her past but this video was prettymuch being referred to as Colleengaslighting People all throughout herresponse did not align with viewersexpectations and her video is filledwith plenty of negative comments for themost part rather than directlyaddressing the issue Colleen chose toexpress herself through a song shementioned that her management team hadstrongly advised her against speakingher mind but she realized they neverprohibited her from singing she prettymuch referred to all the things comingout about her as a toxic gossip trainshe clarified several years ago I usedto communicate with my fans however itwasn't in a creepy manner as some of youwere insinuating it was more of adesperate attempt to befriend anyone ina somewhat pitiful way she admitted thatduring the early stages of her careershe had failed to recognize theimportance of establishing boundariesbetween herself and her fans and sheasserted that she has since transformedher contact and taken responsibility forher actions however she proceeded tocriticize the allegations against herconstantly referring to them as productsof the toxic gossip terrain that thriveson malicious accusations Colleen opensup by stating I've been going through atough time so I decided to take a shortbreak there are many things being saidabout me that aren't entirely accuratehowever whether it's true or not doesn'tseem to matter as long as it providesentertainment for you she proceeds tosay hello everyone I've been wanting toaddress a few matters online although myteam strongly advised against speakingmy mind I recently realized they neverprohibited me from expressing myselfthrough a song yeah and that's exactlywhat she did she continued saying forover 15 years I have shared my lifeonline I have poured my heart out to youand because of that I feel like I'mtalking to my friends the chorus of hersong emphasized the toxic gossip trainderailing someone's reputation chin jumpaboard the toxic gossip train but if youopen your eyes you'll realize it's builton lies and maybe the person you despisedidn't deserve such harsh judgment yeahshe just kept on repeating sometimespeople can make mistakes you just gottalet them know gotta let them grow butit's like as a woman in her 30s sheshould have known better and all thestuff that came out about her isn't tobe categorized as some little oldmistake I mean there were numerousvideos on top of videos where heractions were persistently deemed asdeplorable and that's why people arecommenting things like I've been a fanfor over seven years and I've alwayssupported you but these allegationsaren't just rumors they're actuallyevidence-based this isn't takingaccountability it doesn't matter ifyou've never had any bad intentions afact goes over intention always I usedto think you would take responsibilityin a situation like this but to see thatthis is the response is honestly sodisappointing Colleen's next book how tocompletely decimate your career with aukulele anyone have a better title allshe did was talk about herself and howshe feels LOL also I love how she'strying to make this look spontaneouswhen it's obviously calculated and she'strying to manipulate us girly dug agrave for herself with this one ColleenI actually don't know what to say shereally came up with this and said Yupthis is the way to go says a lot Ididn't think your apology video could beworse than silence but she approved usall wrong here there are so many waysyou could have handled this this was oneof the weirdest this made it worseColleen mistakes are not the same as baddecisions this is so bizarre I have BPDtrauma and other that I've been throughand knows what it's like to be heavilyaffected by your emotions and beingimpulsive but this is still somethingshe chose to upload and edit andcalculate I'm so so confused and thisvideo just screams passiveaggressiveness and blaming everyone elseI got no words this is literally thedefinition of tone deaf and manipulativeI'm actually shocked any sympathy that Ihad for Colleen is 100 gone one personauditing I think the sad truth aboutthis is that Colleen is gonna be fine inthe long run Shane got brutally canceledJames committed literal crimes and theyboth still got lots of used money andhave influencer friends most of theseinfluencers aren't in it to be a goodperson they're in it for the money andso far it doesn't seem like anyone hasreally been successfully kicked off theinternet no matter how bad they are orhow your apology was the most ofall y'all can do is just ignore thesepeople I haven't watched her ever sinceshe started having her kids on cameraall the time so it's almost like shewanted to make the situation worseanyways concluding her video Colleensings saying to anyone who has eversupported me in any way I genuinelyappreciate you thank you sometimespeople make

06/21/2023,Jeffree Star is Wild (opening a meat + greet shop),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-8aBk8Hql0,151-9,Jeffree Star is having a makeup and me  meet and greet like makeup and me from his Yaks with a side of a picture with him Jeffrey is always cooking up some sort of crazy idea and doesn't ever care what people really have to say whether it's a controversial makeup palette or deciding to become a farmer since Moving to Wyoming Jeffrey hasn't stopped pumping out makeup he's been launching products like he was when he was living in California but he also decided to get into the meat industry and after posting a bunch of pictures with his Yaks one day he sprung on his followers that he was also going to be starting to sell meat their meat some people were kind of horrified since they thought the Yaks were mostly Jeffrey's new pets since he had been saying they were bringing him so much peace and comfort into his life so to see some of them packed up and in a freezer fans were very confused but Jeffrey ended up coming out and clarifying that the Yaks that he posts on Instagram are or his pets and not the one that he packages up and sells to people in restaurants and all that and he has different Yachts that he uses for his new meat business so no I met a layer um I started raising Yaks over a year ago and I still have a 120 pets and the only Yaks that you guys have ever seen on social media are my pets any tag with a name is my pet people are so I think if you just don't like me in general you're just hopping on this thing today maybe it's Memorial Day Weekend you're bored but I'm like girl stop making up in your heads people are literally making up their own narratives your soldering this was chocolate and Buster no they're actually right outside the window grazing on the grass but now Jeffrey is combining his two passions and is actually opening up a store in Wyoming and I thought since he's been talking about this store so much that it was going to be a cosmetic store but that's actually not the case it's way more than that it's Beauty with a snack on the side maybe he'll even do like a little Costco Sample stand or something while you're trying to match your concealer you can try out a little Yak meat or something like imagine imagine he did that but in all seriousness Jeffrey announced the grand opening date for his store on Instagram and said he's also doing a meet and greet that day all right y'all it's time I said it yesterday I said that I would announce the date of the grand opening of the Jeffree Star store makeup and meat right here in downtown Casper Wyoming July 14th baby mark it on the calendar go click the next post and I cannot wait to see you all next month makeup and meet and greet what an experience he posted on Instagram this huge flyer that said the details of things the address that was going to be coming soon he said huge announcement my first ever retail store is opening on July 14th the Jeffree Star store makeup and me is one of a kind and located in the heart of downtown Casper Wyoming the store will have the full range of JSC products as well as the full range of meat products from Star Yak Ranch there will be exclusive products only available at the store come celebrate the grand opening and pink ribbon cutting party with us I'll be doing a mean greet of course whether you are a local or traveling from out of state this event is going to be incredible and I would be honored if you joined we are partnering up with David Street Station to have a live musical concert and plenty of yak to taste see you there people were a little confused in commented things like cruelty free vegan makeup but sells me how is a brand cruelty free but selling me at the same time time it's like oh no we don't do animal testing because that's a hard no but we do offer animal tasting which is completely in line with the cruelty free part must be hard being a clown on the side of all of this as well what a weird combo though makeup and me so clearly people were quite thrown off by the Meat part but when Jeffrey first announced that he was going to be selling Yak meat he addressed these kinds of comments back then it was a vegan makeup brand for a living y'all know I eat meat every day what have I ever claimed to be vegan no I'm on year eight of Jeffree Star cosmetics and I created it so it can be inclusive and everyone could wear it so I guess some people forgot that Jeffrey did address this whole vegan makeup brand but that doesn't mean that I'm vegan and I'm going to keep my makeup away from meat it's definitely interesting and certainly just a combination for a store but then again like I guess they do sell like makeup products at Target and they sell me at Target in like grocery stores and stuff I don't know it's funny when you think about it that way but it's like like weird with Jeffrey and I didn't know that this was his plan all along but actually back in November Jeffrey announced that he had bought the space for the store and was working on it he said on Instagram I'm so excited to announce that I'm opening up my first retail store you will be able to shop all things Jeffree Star located in downtown Casper Wyoming right in the heart of the old Yellowstone District this store has over 7 000 square feet and will also be an interactive space inside you will be able to shop the full Jeffree Star cosmetics and Jeffree Star skin product lines and also star yacht Ranch frozen meat Yak plushies and anything star yak related there will be exclusive makeup and merch only available here besides having several shopping experiences there will also be a section where you can come see things from the Jeffree Star Museum every few months there will be different exotic cars to come view from my fleet huge huge props from our cosmetic campaigns that never get to be seen and so much more you can come in and take pictures of so this is something that is going to be way more than your average store I mean 7 000 square feet is a huge amount of space and I was just like what is he going to be doing with all this like he showed pictures of what this place was looking like and to fill it up with just makeup and a couple freezers of yaks like there had to be something more so it does seem like it's going to be a Jeffree Star photo op type of place and it's just such a random location for him to be doing this obviously there's a lot of land there and it's cheaper and more accessible for him to be getting 7 000 square foot any type of building anything over there than in somewhere like LA or anywhere in California but I just wonder like who is going to be going to this how often are they gonna be going to this like how are you gonna keep this up it just seems like such a big project but it was originally set to be open in Spring of this year but now it is Summer and the time has come for him to open his doors to his Beauty meat market and Jeffrey is planning this launch to be a huge event he is asking other people that have businesses in the area to be a part of this big event that he is throwing he's turning it into kind of like a music festival type of vibe like there's gonna be live music he is hyping it up so much okay there's already a lot of questions you guys I am so excited now today was just a very soft launch announcement more details will come of course very soon the store is looking phenomenal if you've driven past it lately in Casper baby maybe one of the dopest retail stores in Casper history I'm so excited with the progress July 14th is official we of course are going to partner up with David Street Station we're gonna have an amazing band come play we're gonna have live music and there's gonna be Yak food all day you could purchase we're gonna have one of the best people in town make it Mr Corey of occasions by Corey um and we're teaming up with all the locals it is going to be absolutely epic you guys and I'm so excited for the store launch so come join us for the pink ribbon cutting of course I'm going to be doing a very long meet and greet and it is going to be epic he's also expecting fans from all over to fly in for the event telling them which airport to go to now I know a lot of the Die Hard star family is going to want to fly in I am so excited if you're traveling from out of the country or out of state the airport code here is so easy to remember CPR that's Casper Wyoming CPR now flights are going to be limited we literally only have two gates here at our tiny little airport and a lot of my team has already booked their flights in advance of course um family friends and employees are coming and this is going to be the event of the year and as much as I'm like who is going to this he has had events in the past where I must say I was surprised that people came especially when he was selling the yak meat he was showing this huge line of people that were ready to try his Yak me like Jeffrey has some freaking fans in Wyoming it's actually quite crazy say hi y'all yes let's go outside and say hi to everyone bedroom oh my God what's up hey y'all today was insane first of all shout out to everyone that came down to our Yak meat pop-up um it was amazing there was people from all over I was so this whole thing will be very very interesting to see how a store does for him I really want to know what you guys think about the fact that Jeffrey is doing all of this and how you think this will do for him business-wise like this just seems so random and the location is random but I also just feel like why would he do it if he felt like no one was gonna come I guess but let me know how you guys feel about it in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys thank you [Music] 
06/21/2023,James Charles is Upset (starbucks drama),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqjLMqwjqiE,150-12,remember James Charles pinkity drinkity era he always had one in his hand this morning you guys know I start off my day every single day with a Starbucks Pink Kitty drinking my first ever pinkity drinkity how do you feel give us a review pinkity drinkity well now he wants a little credit for popularizing the Starbucks drink and a bunch of people are arguing with him online about this topic this all got brought up because Starbucks decided to release a bottle version of their pink drink in stores and James recently got his hands on it and decided to vent on Tick Tock about the fact that Starbucks never paid him for getting everyone to try this drink I found it for literally there until this morning I was walking down the aisle this literally caught the corner of my ice creaming sister up at me from the Shelf Starbucks recently decided to bottle their pinkity drinkity and now sell it in grocery stores all across America where's my check that's what I want to know where is my check I want the royalties on this a lot of you don't like me and that's okay but I know every single one of you in 2018 went to Starbucks and ordered a pinkity drinkity because of me because of me this used to be on their secret menu but when I started talking about this they became so popular that they officially got added to the real Starbucks menu and now it is still to this day one of the most popular drinks that they sell and I get nothing literally nothing not a single cent They sent me a DM in 2018 thanking me for making it super viral and were like oh my God we should talk I obviously wrote back being like love you guys let's do a commercial let's do a campaign let's do like a whole branded thing fully left me on red and a week later they unset their original DM admitting that it was all my idea and thanks to me that it became a thing I should sue oh honestly I stopped drinking this a very long time ago because it was giving me explosive diarrhea and making me fart non-stop so anyway let's try it out shall we cheers to millions of dollars down the drain yup it tastes exactly like a pink Drink I hate that it's good now this isn't the first time that James has seemingly taken credit for popularizing the drink he stitched a video on Tick Tock before of a Starbucks employee saying mid pink Drink disassociating to the fact that James Charles invented this drink and now I make 30 per shift and he captioned it saying I stopped drinking them so long ago because one Starbucks refused to cut me a check and two they made me fart someone else ended up replying to James and said so embarrassing watching him go along with a lie that he invented it I literally remember ordering it in 2016 and being an aesthetic Pinterest thing he just repopularized it in 2018 and yes it actually was created back in 2016 and we'll get into it but over the years James has stayed pretty consistent in being the pink Drink representative and on impulsive a while back he also talked about the fact that he popularized the dream we did get you your favorite Starbucks drink I believe I got a pink drink this drink is literally on the menu because of me um it was you have you used to have to order this by ordering it was a venti strawberry acai refresher with coconut milk and water all right okay so is it secret menu it used to be but then so many people I just started calling it The Pink drink on Snapchat and stuff and so many other people started actually on the menu right that's what Danny said yeah it blew up and Starbucks literally DM you'd be like oh my God we have so many people order the pink tanks like we love you and I was like oh we'd love to work together or something and they ignored it no come on and that's done and that's dumb you you literally have proven that you're like a market maker now there's a lot of confusion I think with this because some people think James is claiming that he invented the drink when that's not actually true the pink Drink was a thing way before James that popularized it in 2018 and I know because I remember my roommate in college working at Starbucks in 2016 and I literally have this screenshot on my phone from when someone was drinking the drink and I remember her starting to bring it home after after this so he definitely didn't invent it two years later popularized for sure but in Ben I don't think so I definitely do remember it being easier to order the drink after James started talking about it though because they knew what the pink Drink was and you didn't have to say strawberry acai with coconut milk but some of the wording in the replies under his Tick Tock Eventing about this had people feeling like he was trying to say that he invented the drink entirely and that's when it turned into a whole thing someone said to him James if it was on the secret menu doesn't that mean someone created it before you and he said there's no actual secret menu I started ordering it by customizing the refresher and I called it a pink drink then they added it to the real menu someone from Starbucks ended up replying to James upset that he was trying to take credit or feels entitled to some credit for something that he didn't actually create where is my check I want the world this literally makes me excuse me that I look like a mess right now but I was working at Starbucks in 2016 2017 when the pink Drink was actually put on the menu and it was put on the menu by Lady Gaga so Lady Gaga and Starbucks came together and they decided that 10 of the proceeds sold by the pink Drink And The Violet drink would be given to the Born This Way foundation so no you did not make it popular and no you did not put it on the menu because lady how God put it on the menu and in this little video he talks about how Starbucks sent him a message and then later deleted it that's probably because they've realized believe a couple years ago Lady Gaga put this on the menu and here is the proof for my last video Starbucks and Lady Gaga create cups of kindness collection June 2017. see here it is this is this one's a violet drink that's the matcha lemonade that's the pink ombre and then that's the pink Drink and it says uh the new Starbucks cups of kindness collection features four Vivid ice beverages hand-picked by Lady Gaga so here it is up there is a new matcha lemonade the new Violet drink and the Ombre pink Drink oh and look at that does it say the pink drink right there it totally says the pink Drink and look at that Starbucks has committed to a minimum of 2500 000 contributions to the Born This Way Foundation it was Lady Gaga who put it on the menu so James Charles please stop now this whole thing made me want to go out and try it for myself honestly because I heard these came out but they've been sold out and I just forgot that they existed so I decided to go on a little trip to the store and see what these bottled pink drinks were like if they were actually like the ones at Starbucks and I honestly also wanted to know if they were going to be chunky because sometimes if you let the Starbucks ones sit for a little bit it gets a little chunky and the Emma Chamberlain canned coffee drink was made with coconut milk and that one was pretty chunky and that was a whole drama and so I wanted to see if this one was gonna Chunk Up or like what the deal was if it tasted like the one from starbeez and shockingly it was super smooth no chunks and I didn't even have to shake it for it to look like this and it tasted exactly like the one from Starbucks and it's so much cheaper like this was 3.99 and the drink at Starbucks for Grande which is basically like half a cup up in some ice is 5.95 so if you like this drink and get it often honestly this might be the move for you if you can find it because everywhere was saying sold out but don't forget to thank James Charles while you're there because he seems to think that he deserves some credit for this drink being so popular and for the invention of the name the pink Drink I certainly do want to know what you guys think about the fact that James is mad at Starbucks for not giving him credit or writing him a check for talking about the pinkity drinkity do you guys think that he deserved a little something for it or did you already know about the drink before he started drinking them all the time I definitely think that they could have done some sort of campaign with him because he was very popular back then like 2018 was his Prime and that's when everyone was loving him and I feel like he could have been in like a little ad or something but also back then I just feel like a lot of people weren't taking influencers seriously I feel like brand deals weren't being thrown around like they are now I know a lot of people don't like to say that influencers are the same thing as a celebrity but they kind of are like they hold a lot of power they sell products there's a lot of people that are watching them that look up to them want to buy the things that they like and at that time James was super big but I feel like it wasn't until 2020 in Tick Tock that people started to look at influencers as celebrities because I think that Charlie demilio and Addison Ray really changed the game I mean Charlie with a hundred million followers these are like unheard of numbers and there was so many people watching them and I feel like a lot of companies started to see that influencers really do have a lot of people that are looking at them and they do bring in a lot of numbers I mean that's literally how Addison Ray got that movie deal on Netflix was because they knew that people were going to watch the movie because of Addison whether they liked her or not and she delivered she brought in a ton of viewers but I feel like back then Starbucks probably was just like eh I don't know if it's like the right thing to do in influencer collaboration in and I'm not saying that there were no brand deals before like Addison Ray and like 2020 and stuff because there definitely were but I just see like a lot of them were still skeptical on the whole thing and I feel like they just could have done something fun with James at the time even though this is supposedly Lady Gaga's drink that she created in 2016. it didn't have to be like the James Charles pink drink but he could have just been holding it up for like an ad and I feel like it would have been like a fun little thing but it didn't happen and he's clearly still very bitter about it but that's what's going on with James wanting his little check from starbeez let me know what you guys think in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys [Music] 
06/20/2023,Colleen Ballinger Being A CREEP Is Getting Worse,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcYJSw9DyPU,152-9,Colleen Ballinger is under major fire at the moment since she's not only been exposed for allegedly being a terrible person but for also being super inappropriate with minors the whole thing has been going on for years and Adam McIntyre whose life she basically tried to ruin has decided to try and expose everything she ever did to him and others and he is not holding back I do believe that she brimmed me I also believe she used me some people have felt disgust for Colleen over the years I mean some people even believe that her entire Miranda Sings character's only personality trait was to act stupid and gross and I'm sure that just made a lot of people feel uncomfortable and she honestly should have been canceled like a long time ago with how terrible some of the things she's done have been which I'll get into in just a moment however that's not to say that people haven't tried to cancel her before but it's never become this big of a thing Adam made his first video about the situation three years ago but unfortunately many of her fans turned against Adam rather than showing support his video titled Colleen Ballinger stop lying talked about how he had been a fan of Colleen ever since he was 12. and about how Colleen eventually reached out to him and began taking advantage of him for years he started off by talking about how Colleen first started messaging him and how it very quickly turned pretty weird very quickly we started talking a lot and my parents were really happy to see the fact that someone like Colleen Ballinger was so dedicated to talking to all of her fans this slowly turned into me getting private details about her divorce and what was happening with the relationship with her ex-husband around this time though was whenever my parents start getting a little bit more cautious and we're wondering why a 30 year old was talking to at this time a 13 year old fighter divorce eventually they leave the teen when they first started texting was to get him to find out drama for her that she could use for Content she was basically using him to do her job for her and not even paying him for it and Adam who really didn't even know any better since he was literally 13 was ecstatic to be doing all of this for Colleen since he looked up to her so much the worst part is that Colleen not only continued to use him in this way but also took it even further by asking to engage in Gossip sites about her which eventually led him to get a lot of hate and Adam the character the person whatever you want to call it started getting really attacked on these sites too now keep in mind I was only 14 at this time so then I was getting targeted on these gossip sites and I was getting called a pick me manipulative and other words I won't say just because my extended family are watching this video and I I really I can't I Adam's Family did get involved at this point asking him to stop engaging with her because it was starting to become damaging to him but unfortunately it was a pretty hard thing to do since he had invested so much time into her and she also just wouldn't let him go because y'all Colleen would constantly do small things for Adam like subscribing to his YouTube channel or leaving comments which made him very happy just so she could ask him to do more stuff for her and overall just stringing him along for her own benefit one time she even promised him that she'd fly him and his brother out to America so they could go to VidCon which shocker never actually happened Adam did admit that he kept falling for her tricks which isn't really a surprise since he was literally 14 and cannot be blamed because I was dumb impressionable young naive whatever I want to call I have so many names for what I believe I was I'd always cave honestly Adam also revealed that Colleen would always contact him and talk to him about her divorce and the trouble that she had with her ex-husband and so it's no surprise that this was some really heavy information to lay on a 14 year old especially because to Adam they were the perfect couple from her YouTube videos so I can't even imagine how damaging this must have been for him but probably the worst thing she ever did to Adam was the fact that she found his Twitter account so funny that she decided to send him lingerie for some reason this grown woman thought it was completely alright to send a child underwear they went on my Twitter because they thought it was funny and then they said they had to send me the bra and panties here are some clips from that live stream [Laughter] [Music] ing homeschooled Christian University real on this this is honestly the worst outfit he's so rude what made you order these ugly clothes bottom these those clothes are nasty he's so rude oh my God he's so sassy your Twitter guy is making me laugh so much oh my God that makes me laugh I want to send him something do you want the bra Adams do you want the brown panties tweet right now oh my God yeah Adam let me know what you want okay I'm sending him something okay maybe he'll want the panties although then his parents will be like you're not allowed to watch who's sending you panties mom don't worry I watched the boy wear them online first and guys she was not joking she literally did mail it to him and he still has it to this day because his mom had understandably taken it away am I doing like a haul for you I don't know and then I hate touchnap then these I don't know which way they go but these as well so I was genuinely still surprised that my mom had these and anyways Colleen didn't stop reaching out to Adam and even made him her social media manager at one point which ended terribly it all started off as him just giving her tweet ideas but it quickly escalated into her giving him free reign of her Twitter account um whenever we talked behind Miranda wasn't really doing well anymore she messaged me and then said well help me and that's them whenever I started giving the Tweet ideas so on the 25th of March of this year I started giving more ideas again because kaleem is aware that the Miranda character was becoming very stale and inactive on social media and on the 26th of March again she started tweeting my ideas which included Animal Crossing stuff so on the 25th and 26th I presented her with about 15 different tweet ideas so then came a tweet about Miranda Sings coming out as a Meghan Trainor fan which she was initially confused about and she says I don't know what you're saying about Megan so then I explained it again and Colleen was fully gonna go ahead posting it herself as you can see here so I helped give her the photos and the concept and she said when should I do that should I do that today or tomorrow before I post the video and I said what are you waiting for today and she says okay cool showing that she had every single intention to post this tweet on her own behalf Colleen offered him a social media intern position and even promised an hourly rate in the future if things went well now this obviously didn't end well and honestly even if it had it's hard to imagine her keeping that promise with her track record at the time Adam was of course super excited to do this for her not realizing the damage it would cause and he went on to tweet something on her account which he at the time didn't realize was harmful but it got her into a lot of trouble the Tweet was about how Miranda was coming out as a Meghan Trainor fan which was obviously badly received since it looked like she was making fun of the lgbtq plus Community this ended in Colleen getting mad at Adam even though he had asked her beforehand if it was okay to tweet and she approved it she was actually going to post it herself before Adam took over the account but because he was the one to actually tweet it she ended up being super guilt-trippy towards him and made him feel bad for having caused her to get hate and she said the thing is I agree with them queerbaiting is not a joke I'm super sad of upset so many people I'm telling you girl I'm super sensitive like near tears again trying to guilt me and make me feel really bad for something that she had already approved and find funny and she didn't see any problems with it I'm gonna be really honest for a second I spent that entire day just crying in bed and texting my friends and my mom and dad were just comforting me the entire day I was a mask that day I was completely radio silent on everything ask any of my friends from that day it was such a horrible day like it was so so awful I didn't even get a message from Colleen Austin who I was it was just guilt-tripping me that I had done all this to her almost as if I had planned it or something so she continued to talk about it she said it's all anyone is talking about I'm really upset I would never post something like that at night everyone thinks I'm homophobic I'm really really upset by the end of it Adam ended up being the one to comfort Colleen in this situation and promise that the whole thing would blow over and the worst part is is that she left him on red and that was actually the last he had ever heard from her so to recap Colleen found this 13 year old boy who was a devoted supporter and then started using him for video ideas send him lingerie made him her social media manager and then blamed him when it all blew up in her face traumatized him and then never talked to him again today A lot of people are questioning how she wasn't Beyond canceled the first time that Adam posted that video video but Colleen swarm of fans somehow looked past all of this and decided to not only keep supporting her but also to send Adam so much hate and she even actively encouraged this and guys Adam revealed that he had gotten sent some DMS of Colleen's best friend Corey who was talking badly about Adam in a group chat with fans and also telling them what Colleen was saying about Adam Cory was basically saying that Colleen thinks this one Twitter account that was hating on fans was Adam and telling all these other fans that Adam was now going around trolling and attacking Colleen and her fans because of everything that happened obviously a lot of her fans believed all that stuff and started accusing the victim in this situation of being the one to blame for what Colleen was going around doing anyways guys things obviously didn't end there as recently a lot of allegations against Colleen have been brought up again especially by the YouTuber Cody rantz who spoke up about their experience with Colleen and how they felt manipulated by Colleen Cody uploaded a video called why I left the calling Ballinger fandom where they addressed the relationship they had Colleen years ago which was very similar to Adams Cody joined Colleen's fandom and became a pretty well-known figure by joining well-known Twitter group chats and even getting close with Colleen's friends and family but Cody has come out now to prove how truly disturbing the things that were going on were in their video Cody addressed Adam's situation and how their initial reaction was shock and disgust my immediate thought was what Cody then showed a DM Colleen had sent them which explained her side of the story after she stopped responding to Adam where she basically said that Adam was lying about a lot of things and showing things out of context which he would get major backlash for if she were to expose him and said that the reason she wasn't speaking out was because she wanted to respect him as a minor and his family and that she was really sad and disappointed by everything and this was all an attempt to get Cody to turn against Adam because she clearly knew that Cody would make a video on this situation since it was everything anyone was talking about Colleen's that I now realize I never should have been communicating with him in the first place referring to the fact that this was a minor and then Cody pulled out some extremely shocking receipts like people were shocked he's not even the only child that she was talking to she was literally in DMS talking to Children about scx here's one are you a virgin this is Colleen in a group chat with children they're called the weenies this is the group chat you're in the coin Ballinger fandom you know about this group chat she's also asking what's your favorite position this grown woman was asking miners these things and was just now realizing that maybe that was bad Cody also pointed out how completely inappropriate Colleen was for children since her content was filled with things like this was it satire when you joked about this work multiple times was the satire of you joking about our wording your then husband was it satire you telling people they should are word your friend Harvey was it satar you joking about our wording your Young audience's Twitter feeds using the hardwood again and let's not forget the fact that she also has this written in one of her old thumbnails like guys why was she literally admitting that she is a pedophile anyways Cody then referenced the video they made on Adam years ago where they defended Colleen and basically discredited everything Adam was saying and admitted that she was manipulated by Colleen into making it and y'all Cody showed what Colleen had sent them as proof that Adam was lying which is her responding to his last text message that he didn't include in his original video but she dm'd me was so I would make this video I would make a video that would defend her and it worked and that's sad I was so excited when she messaged me I was like oh my God she's confiding to me I was gonna be her knight in shining armor right in Colleen's text she not only referred to the whole thing as Adam's drama twice but also flat out denied that she was talking badly about Adam when he literally had screenshot proof I'm not really sure how this was supposed to prove her innocence at all but unfortunately Cody did fall for the charm of having her Idol message her and played right in to what she wanted y'all I was trying to get her to tell me stuff I wanted her to like me okay I didn't actually know if he was lying or not I didn't care I wanted her to notice me I'm just being honest I was mentally ill and a person that I idolized was messaging me so I was just really in the dark like I had rose-colored glasses on I did not know how bad of a person she was and it's just really sad and I think that's why I was still trying to like be on her good side even though I didn't really like what she was doing to Adam I just really wanted to get the DMS for my video and I really wanted to have something else that other people hadn't had and I was the only person that she was talking to in the drama community and I didn't want to like mess it up and have her just like go away and not say anything because I was afraid she wasn't going to apologize and I thought well maybe if I get her on my side like maybe I can get her to say something I don't know it was a hot mess express it was super clear that Cody was too close to Colleen to have made that video something that they thankfully admit to now and they've even said it was a full on parasocial relationship I'm being so dramatic I'm so sorry that I was so Manic and wild and was in a parasocial relationship with this woman to the point where I was being mean to a literal kid but all that doesn't change what happened in the past and the fact that Cody's video had a lot of negative impact on Adam they literally texted Colleen my plan is to paint the video to show Adam manipulates you into trusting him and he had a master plan to take you down when you got mad about the Miranda thing and Cody wasn't a child at this point they were an adult and really should have known how messed up this whole thing is but at the same time it's also very clear that Colleen was trying to twist the situation into looking like the victim in front of Cody who idolized her Cody also exposed the fact that Corey was just as much in on the situation as Colleen was and he was even hate talking Adam in Cody's DMS which Cody claimed was him being manipulative so he could turn them against Adam Adam deserves to see this everyone deserves to see what kind of people these people are the only time I said his name was when we wondered if he ran the hate account this is the Galaxy Colleen account which I made a video on I wondered if he ran the heat account because for years people have sent a screenshots of him hating on us where I hate how he acted like I was friends with him but if he was a child so guys this was all Colleen and Corey basically trying to put the responsibility on someone else so that she could have people expose Adam for her so that she wouldn't get the backlash for going after a child but also let me just mention the fact that Cody's replies in some of these DMS are a really weird thing for an adult to say about a child as well and just because they apologize doesn't mean that it's okay to talk about Adam in this way like why are they calling him weird for being friends with these adults instead of the other way around anyways y'all Adam ended up reacting to everything Cody had exposed about Colleen since they were the first person to side with him after all these years and it clearly gave him some sort of closure to hear that it wasn't all in his head Adam also addressed the fact that Colleen's creepy messages to kids in the Wendy's group chat that Cody showed were actually addressed to him I never thought these matches would get out but that was to me these messages were to me in our group chat with Colleen we were in a group chat called the Weenies and I wrote in the group chat and said I'm doing a YouTube q a and I need questions and Colleen was like so this was like 2017 2016 so I would have been [Music] 15 or something like that 15-ish and I was like innocently [ __ ] me but even then I mean you know Stan mentality but even just on a baseline of how it went so I wrote in the group chat and was like and by the way by the look at this Adam Adam you need questions for your q a are you a virgin in the same thing to address the fact that because of the video they made defending Colleen and at the time he said that he actually forgives Cody for everything since they were too manipulated by Colleen and he couldn't blame someone for going through the same things that he did but y'all Adam actually ended up taking that forgiveness back when he found out that Cody wasn't actually trying to look out for Adam when they posted their video if you have the screenshots and you cared about Adam for three years why wouldn't you have given him the screenshots and and Cody goes and I quote these words that they said are the reasons that I take back ever forgiving Cody for what they did to me Cody said because it was my story to tell and this was all after Cody and Adam had talked about how effective they were by the entire thing and Adam had even opened up about how he had a hard time trusting people after everything that happened and Cody goes out there and posts that video to tell their story so they can get some views and get some revenge on Colleen and Corey and not because Colleen had literally the child and turned his life to Hell honestly I completely understand why Adam got so mad when he heard them refer to it as their story since the video was literally all about Adam and even ended up ruining his life everybody thought that he was a liar after Cody exposed him but thankfully the screenshots from weenie's group chat could finally give Adam concrete proof that Colleen really was inappropriate with him another thing that Adam uncovered is actually the fact that in Colleen's own video where she addressed the situation a few years ago she makes it very clear that she wasn't the one to send Adam the underwear and that he begged her to send it to him and basically just made it sound like Adam had lied about her sending it to him because she thought his tweets were so so funny that she could make it look like he was lying about the other stuff too but what really happened is that Colleen Twisted the video to fit her narrative Colleen fully manipulated the actual truth so that she could make Adam who was a child look bad in front of her audience this was also after Cody had posted their video which means that Adam was just getting attacked from all sides at that point and had no way of defending himself because he didn't have any of the proof that he has today Adam also had another stream with people who were also in the weenies group chat who revealed that Colleen told them not to watch Adam's original video and the reason they all turned against him was because they never knew what Colleen had done to him but because of that stream where the other members of the group chat got to tell their stories of Colleen and share even more screenshots of her being gross and creepy Adam started getting swarmed with even more hate and even death threats and doxing the whole thing got so bad that Adam had to get the police involved since he genuinely started to fear for his safety thankfully a lot of people have stood up for Adam after everything has been addressed and a bunch of people have also come out and described how they've had similar encounters with Colleen where she had made them feel uncomfortable and there have even been videos shared of Colleen being inappropriate with children on stage all it takes is a little breeze and I'll see all the bits so this is a very good example of what you don't want to address like so this is porn what's your name Grace exactly so first type of horn is clothing okay this is example not porn porn not porn porn yeah guys and these are just some of the instances and so many people have come out to share their experiences and thankfully a lot of people are seeing Colleen's true colors after all these years and canceling her for good anyways loves thanks so much for watching and make sure to comment down below what you think of this whole situation and don't forget to click here for more drama 
06/18/2023,Oli London Is DESPERATE For Attention & Needs To Stop,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGdeM80m1Io,149-11,get some popcorn and hold on to your seats because Ollie London is back in the spotlight with yet another jaw-dropping story and causing a stir like never before for those of you who don't know Ollie London is basically a wannabe K-pop Star who has become one of the most talked about people on the internet for doing some pretty shady and shocking things so why does he do what he does is it for attention or is there seriously something wrong with him Ali is a British influencer television personality and singer who became famous for his major obsession with Korean pop culture specifically the K-Pop group BTS I'm Ali London I'm obsessed with K-pop and BTS but who isn't obsessed with BTS Ali London's obsession is quite more than your typical average fan according to Ali his obsession with jimin from BTS and Korean culture began when he lived in seal for a year in 2013. it was during this time that he taught English and discovered the world of K-pop so with that in mind Ali embarked on a super expensive cosmetic surgery journey in an attempt to look exactly like his favorite BTS member Park jimin you look at the pictures we're identical really okay I know I'm identical no you're not when I was in Korea everyone calls me jimin when I'm walking down the street everyone's like oh my God it's Jimmy Jimmy all right everyone that's a load of crap you think I'm jimin Ollie spent a jaw-dropping 300 000 on over 30 surgeries over the next nine years Ollie whitened his skin and vampire facials basically whatever it took to achieve the perfect look Ali was willing to go the extra mile and spare no expense but somehow that still wasn't enough he spent an additional seventy thousand dollars on one surgery just so he could achieve his dream of looking like K-pop Mega star and his favorite BTS member Park jimin there's a message for Dr Phil so I just convinced my transition to the Korean to look just like jimin this I think is my final procedure so I'm so so happy so now that I'm done Korea I'm really trying to find jimin I'm going to all of his favorite Hangouts favorite places oh my gosh I love you that's it man I love you I love you so much starting hey BTS [Music] Ollie's story became public and he became one of the most talked about people on the internet for thinking that he could change his whole appearance and his race to look like the spitting image of someone else this of course attracted haters and people who actually empathized with Ollie man has spent 150 000 on numerous surgeries can't feel his face all to look like his K-pop Idol German he wants to look like Jim oh oh every Memorial but the big question on everyone's mind was whether Ollie's actions were fueled by a genuine passion or simply a thirst for fame and clout loves how far is this guy willing to go just for attention but look the drama doesn't end there and as time went on Ollie's statements and actions seem to contradict one another he continued to identify as Korean while also expressing his intentions to undergo more surgeries despite claiming to be a fan of BTS and Korean culture his actions and behavior often seem to prioritize attention and fame over genuine respect and appreciation prepare yourselves because this might just blow your mind most recently Ollie took to social media to announce his most notorious stunt yet Ollie had tied the knot to whom you might ask but none other than his favorite K-pop Star Park jimin not the actual person oh no but a cardboard cutout of park jimin that's right people Ollie London got married to a cardboard cutout can you believe it this raised eyebrows and left many people questioning his Kennedy and his intentions at the age of 29 Ali London took to the streets of Las Vegas to say I do in front of an Elvis Presley impersonator and tied the knot so Jimmy is our wedding congratulations on getting married to none other than me so that we can listen to something that I'm so happy my husband and with that he officially became one half of the most unconventional couple of the century Ollie said that it was such an emotional ceremony and that he felt so much love jimin was his Idol and that he had spent a lot of money on surgeries to look like him and now he has actually married him and he couldn't be happier I guess congratulations are in order for the happy couple who are we to question love here's to love in all its quirky forms right me and Jimena are going to get a divorce he hasn't even talk to me anymore carpool gym it's so 20 20. I can't date cardboard I'm a 32 year old man like seriously but of course short-lived as 2021 that he was divorcing the cardboard cutout and marrying a real person instead his new partner Danny Richardson is a 19 year old who shares his love for BTS and jimin Ollie's marriage and divorce to a cardboard cutout of jimin not only shocked the internet but also divided opinions some to this day still label him as crazy and delusional soon after the cardboard cutout wedding Extravaganza headlines started swirling about the demise of our Infamous media personality could it be so with Ollie London really dead Ollie had gone silent online and fans were quick to point out that his Instagram had been memorialized seemingly to indicate that he was dead but a section of his K-pop followers had their doubts the K-pop fans strongly believed that he was pulling off a suicide prank Ali had a history of being canceled by K-pop fans and the last time he faced their wrath was earlier in 2021 when he opened up about feeling sad and disappointed over trolls canceling him on Tick Tock the trolls they won I was reported guys my Tick Tock was apparently deleted it was gone for like one hour I think my team my manager my age and my publicists they managed to sort it you will never cancel me trolls thank you he faced a lot of abuse from K-pop fans on his live videos and there was a lot of mean comments aimed at him and people were Mass reporting his account after he had candidly spoken about developing a crush on NCT member taeyong leading to people canceling him oh my God I'm actually actually obsessed with potatoes I might change my face to look like him in the future because I love Trader whistling potato do you think Tayo can hear me in a career maybe he can hear me in Korea the drama was intense but do not worry loves because Ollie appeared from the shadows and came out claiming that his accounts had been hacked but fans were skeptical they were finding it hard to believe that he wasn't doing all of this for attention but Ollie stated repeatedly that he was not it's hard to say whether he truly was a victim or just seeking attention but one thing's for sure Ollie London knows how to keep us glued to our screens on June 18th 2021 in true Ali fashion he dropped a shocking announcement Ollie London took to Twitter to post an image of a rainbow reimagining of the South Korean flag saying that he was now identifying as Korean the last nine years I felt like I've been trapped since I lived in Korea I feel like I identify as Korean everything about the culture is me I feel like I have the look now so this announcement that Alia unified as Korean through major backlash online and many critics argued that the rainbow reimagining that Ollie posted saying that it was offensive to Korean culture and it insulted the flag's meaning transracial does not exist you are not a Korean man no matter how much surgery you do no matter how much of the aesthetic you adopt Ollie came out with his Swift response saying yes he identifies as Korean and guys I now identify fully as Korean I'm so happy I can live my life the way I want to live it finally after being trapped for so long London's manager came out to say that London felt strongly attached to Korea and the Korean culture and feels much more connected to this than his own culture they're happy to have transitioned from British to Korean I hope you like my new eyes I would love to give you a wink right now but I couldn't really not even open my eye I'm now gonna be identical to jimin even more identical than I already was and just you thought you've seen it all Ollie London took us for yet another spin in a classic way only Ollie can pull off this time around he announced that he was identifying as a transgender woman Ali proceeded to say that finally it feels like she has become the person she was born to be after struggling with an identity crisis for eight years Ali revealed that she had undergone surgeries to her face to transform her face to a Korean woman but here's the kicker loves after just six months in a shocking twist even for Ollie Ollie announced that she was transitioning back to a man so why did you decide to become a Korean woman who told you that was possible so obviously I've had a difficult time with my gender identity struggles I was never unhappy with how I looked so I started changing I started dressing as a Korean woman and I realized that was a big mistake and I just wanted to be a boy these twists and turns in Ollie's life seem never ending leaving us all wondering is this a genuine search for self or just an ongoing saga of attention seek we're gonna go to Thailand and I'm gonna undergo a production surgery so I can have the average Korean size did I make you blush do you like it when I call you only time will tell my friends but mark my words we haven't heard the last of Ollie London you never know what surprising news might be just around the corner for this controversial online personality 
06/16/2023,How Salish's Childhood Is Being Taken Away By Her Own Father,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLf1TNONEvA,147-13,hey guys I'm back again with another video on Salish matters since I absolutely am not done talking about this mess because it's extremely concerning that Jordan matter keeps making his daughter do things a 13 year old should absolutely not be doing good luck oh I'm back so I can see your faces it's time to doll and tell him that you love him what and he's been doing it for years first let me catch you guys up so Jordan matter used to be a photographer that built a YouTube channel based on showing the behind the scenes of his photography which could get pretty crazy at times oh my gosh what are you kidding me oh my gosh is also super well known for his 10 minute challenges where he would photograph people in as many weird situations as possible during those 10 minutes go go it's good [Music] she mainly got famous by getting involved with dance photography and Dance Moms in particular do you remember Lily K and Eliana from season seven they got pretty famous for their drama and actually seemed to be his favorites as he has countless videos where he's photographing them which got him a lot of attention at the time but guys this was of course all before his daughter was big enough to put her everywhere so it looks like he had to focus on other children instead it's pretty clear to me that he realized how these popular kids were giving him the most distraction because their children and because their children and had already been used to being in front of a camera from Dance Moms he could practically get them to be in any of his videos since their moms were already on board with them being filmed but then when his son got old enough to be on camera he started showing him more and more but it wasn't his usual photography content and it was actually more Family Channel oriented which is pretty very weird since he was putting him in situations a normal parent probably wouldn't like when he started posting videos titled my son's first kiss and Instagram controls my son's first date his son Hudson wasn't into dance or anything so he was really only on there for the awkward situations that would give him views which is really weird in my opinion and it of course doesn't end with Hudson as Salish eventually started getting featured on his channel more and more at first his videos with her were pretty innocent and there was nothing too concerning about them like this one where she got to adopt a puppy which was pretty cute not gonna lie but as she grew older it's pretty clear to me that he figured out what would attract attention and started featuring her in his usual content like y'all the first video he posted of her in his usual style was called kid versus adult extreme Acro gymnastics competition So Not only was he having his 10 year old daughter do these gymnastics around this grown man but he was also letting her do it in swimsuits and don't even get me started on the fact that this video got more than 50 million views while his other videos at the time got around 20 million or less after that video he slowly started to post more and more about her until eventually she practically became the owner of his YouTube channel but at the same time she started appearing more so did A Boy Called nidal which is where the whole thing starts getting even weirder Jordan made this huge deal about Salish and nidal where he kept putting them into videos together and saying not to ship them over and over again y'all when I tell you he was insistent I mean it they're way too young to ship do not ship them I don't want to see this hashtag anywhere the hashtag it's so weird especially since they're literally 11. he single-handedly made that up and we all know it anyways guys after the First videos of them together they started becoming stars of his channel and he would always put them into weird situations where they had to act like they had crushes on each other and basically pushed this will they won't they narrative however he still continued to act like he was totally against it and none of it was his idea and kept saying that they are not a couple when it is pretty obvious they aren't last video we did together there was a lot of shipping them with a nailish hashtag including voting them as one of the 10 most popular couples that is not okay with me not my little girl no more shipping them despite this he kept making videos like this guys and even started making it look like they might actually be a couple by making them recreate couples photos and couples challenges and the more he started posting about Salish the more invasive some of these videos started getting also let me just point out how Salish has practically grown up with YouTube since her dad has been doing this for a long time so it's kind of all she knows so she probably has no idea how harmful it is to put her entire life out there for everyone to see the most concerning thing for me is the fact that her grown adult father thinks it's totally okay to expose her to all of this but then again he's been working with children I'm putting them in his content practically his entire career so maybe he's not the best man to ask but y'all isn't that so concerning why exactly does he have all this power to bring Salish and these other kids onto his channel and make them do all these weird things knowing full well that this is affecting their entire childhood to him everything is about content even such a thing like his kids first sleepovers is something he is putting online today my daughter Salish and her friend tsunami compete to see who will be the last to fall asleep during their first sleepover throughout the night they attempt insane Instagram dares including two shocking phone calls like why do these kids need a camera shoved into their faces and told to entertain the viewers when they should be having fun and probably gossiping about what's going on in their lives this one sleepover Salish had with her friend tucks me was not only filmed for Millions to see but of course Jordan had to involve naylish into it as well since he won't let anyone forget about them even if he's not actually there do you like her back maybe I don't know about you guys but to me it doesn't seem like these kids have any sort of crush on each other but they're still forced to act like it for the views this isn't even something that only happens on Jordan's Channel as his entire circle seems to be doing the same thing even on nidal's OWN channel they still continue the whole nail-ish thing with videos like reacting to nailish edits and getting dating advice to ask my crush out so it's really not just Salish that's getting this weird treatment and over on nydel's channel we don't even really see any parent involved but it's so clear that they're working behind the scenes to set everything up and Jordan is most likely involved in it as well anyways guys it's starting to look like Jordan is ripping his daughter's childhood away from her and is using everything happening in her life as a YouTube clickbait title which is also shoving nidal into her life and creating this whole Narrative of nailish being a couple his fans definitely love the two together since it looks like his fan base is mostly young kids but that doesn't mean it's all right to keep doing this to them it's very clear a lot of this is extremely scripted as well in order to create drama and salish's life like every single time the two are suddenly asked to confront each other about their crushes FaceTime Nadal and tell him that you love him what no like not as a friend to be honest we all know he likes her [Music] you can't tell him it's a prank and you have to tell him that it's not as a friend but as a real I love you no okay do it let's go let's go I'm not sure I'm okay with this prank everybody out there you know this is not real right what do you think Nadal's gonna say I'm pretty sure this is real oh at this point salish's entire life basically revolves around nidal and her YouTube career which really shouldn't be the case for a 13 year old and it's extremely weird that he keeps getting away with it Jordan is over 50 years old and he hangs around kids all day long and not only dictates what they have to do but also uses them for Content since everybody knows nobody wants to see what he's up to anymore his channel might as well be called Salish matter since it's her doing all the content anyways and Jordan is just profiting off of everyone waiting to see his newly teenage daughter do fan service look at each other closer that's too close too close Okay Okay closer okay hold on okay that's good okay don't get any closer don't listen Gigi stay right there don't go closer I don't even know why he's bothering to act like none of it was his idea in the first place it's also super obvious that Salish and even nidal are very uncomfortable with some of the stuff they're being put through like guys look at this video we didn't actually kiss each other well well he fell but we didn't actually kiss the first time they tried it the doll we got closer and then tripped and something happened didn't happen you guys decide what you think why is he putting puddings about it it's clear they the original video Sailors turn your face far away give him the outside of your cheek quick peck on her cheek get out of here okay okay turn towards me say let's turn towards me get closer noodle go like this like you're gonna do it [Music] go yeah yep right there turn your face shows me a little safe oh my God what was that right no no no no no no no I can't do it I can't do it I will give you the surprise if you don't do it this couldn't have been a more obvious setup and even in that video it looks like neither of them really wanted to be doing that pose again these are barely teenagers and at that age nobody wants to get that close to the opposite gender there's absolutely no way they were comfortable doing this Salish isn't even the only person he's made uncomfortable by doing these things as he's always been known to put kids in uncomfortable situations like for example the entire video he did with Charlie demilio where he kept daring her to do things that clearly made her uncomfortable I want you to go put on pair of glasses come right to this window Tick Tock in front of them okay okay I think she's good you want to go outside sure okay you want to win the middle traffic yeah even in his more recent video Salish and nidal have to do all sorts of things to feed these nail-ish shippers like buying matching necklaces Nate English No it should be like Singlish any doll an Essence yeah we get this silver heart necklace can we have one half an S and one half an N thank you yeah perfect recreating the pasta video before your daddy gets back let's put one of these in our mouth okay and then like remember the thing that we did like a long time ago with the pasta yeah let's do that to Prince Jordan okay all right let's practice yeah good luck ew uh rude I wasn't eating you it was the sweetness of it all right I got the shirt whoa whoa no no what was that okay so-called prank kiss so I can see your faces more guys am I the only one that thinks that's too much I know I keep saying it but Jordan really crosses the line with what he makes these kids do and I'm convinced Salish is going to grow up and be extremely embarrassed by all of these videos especially since she never got to live a normal childhood without having a camera shoved into her face and being told what to do so she can please her fans I think it's pretty clear that Jordan has a serious problem and should honestly be banned from making these kinds of videos with kids in them and that honestly goes for every young person in his videos and not just Salish anyways guys what do you think of what Jordan is doing to Salish let me know in the comments down below and don't forget to check out this other video for more drama 
03/00/2023,Here’s why fans are calling Emma Chamberlain a SCAMMER!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbY9Qo4QKyQ,130-18,Emma Chamberlain really expected people to praise her for scamming her fans again but this time you guys she's actually selling an Instagram DM for ten thousand dollars I'm sorry are you Beyonce I mean even Beyonce would be ashamed to sell a DM for this amount of money it explains why people are not happy with how Emma is still taking advantage of her supporters till this day we all know that she has a history of scamming her fans since day one we're gonna get into all the details in just a second but for now make sure to stay tuned to find out what really went down if you guys know Emma then you probably know how this girl had a revolution throughout her career because she went from posting DIY videos on her channel to straight up modeling for popular magazines and attending the Met Gala to be honest I wouldn't say that she didn't grow up in a very safe and stable environment because from what we've seen on social media her mother and father supported her career ever since she started posting on YouTube and if of course once she gained followers she began experimenting with her content and that's when she really hit the jackpot not only did Emma make her entire personality known as a coffee addict but she even expressed her fashion preferences to her fans and for some reason people really fell in love with it now I'm not sure if this was a huge mistake or not but based on the controversy that followed this situation I would say that it was a big problem the reason why I'm saying this you guys is because many of Emma's fans back in 2018 were obsessed with her as a person I mean the majority of them were trying to copy her aesthetic as an iMovie vlogger and a visco girl and by that they were straight up dressing as Emma in public and copying her entire personality as this funny quirky person this situation you guys made Emma gain tons of supporters at an early age of her career in fact she became known in the YouTube industry immediately as she began collabing with many huge YouTubers such as Tana Mojo James Charles and the Dolan twins despite how she was treated as this Rising YouTuber that could potentially become a huge influencer unfortunately Emma kind of took advantage of this situation to earn money as a side hustle and well this you guys threatened her entire career before it even started from the day people began copying Emma's fashion aesthetic on social media some fans began asking Emma to release her own merch that complements her fashion sense and of course Emma did not hesitate to take advantage of the situation by collabing with the company High key who helped her release tank tops scrunchies denim jackets and even her teddy bear coats although many of her fans were highly disappointed once her merch came out after they realized that the merch pictures on her website were blurred and that they were only sold in one size yeah guys I don't know what Emma was thinking once she made this decision but not only was her merch blurred on the website but they were also expensive as well this you guys made Emma trend on social media with hundreds of fans calling her out for scamming them with cheap merch and and as a result Emma went on live to address the situation by claiming that her merch was hand sewn hence why they were very expensive another reason why it's so expensive and I know this is annoying but it's the same thing I don't know if you guys know the brand UNIF but the brand units like they hand sew like all the clothes and most of the pieces in my line were literally like hand sewn which is cool because it makes it like really nice but it also makes it kind of overpriced like the scrunchies obviously they're scrunchies it's very clear um they were literally hand sewn scrunchies and like there's a little tag in it that like they hand something they're really cute and they're really cute they're really well done and like but literally if you can imagine right like someone in a literal like place was sewing every single scrunchie so obviously we want to pay them as much as possible because they did all that manual labor not you know like whatever like that's a lot of work and of course people sold out her entire website in under two hours it's crazy that this controversy went down back in 2018 and people are still talking about it too this day because a lot of people on social media believe that Emma has a tendency of scamming her fans and this came after she launched her first ever Coffee Company shortly after she scammed her fans with merge I mean if we think about it it totally makes sense why Emma would launch a coffee company out of nowhere because as I mentioned before Emma's entire personality was based on her being obsessed with iced coffee and her being vegan however the launch of her Coffee Company AKA Chamberlain coffee left millions of fans speechless after they noticed that Emma was selling coffee bags for 60 dollars on her website as much as Emma was excited to sell coffee beans for her fans so they could relate to her unfortunately she received major backlash on social media for scamming her fans again and profiting off of her personality now you might think in this case that Emma's Coffee Company would lower their prices or even shut down their business following all the hate however strangely enough the business was able to succeed internationally you guys after Emma alleged made 27 million dollars off of Chamberlain coffee alone you know it's kind of crazy how this girl managed to profit off her business on the verge of being canceled if we're being real I feel like her strong fan base is the reason why Emma is still succeeding to this day because to me it seems like the general public is the only one upset over Emma's business tactics while her fan base on the other hand is supporting Emma constantly I mean if we really think about it I'm pretty sure Emma would have been canceled and forgotten a long time ago if it weren't for her strong and dedicated fan base because we have seen how many of her YouTube Friends such as James Charles and Jeffree Star got immediately neglected after they got canceled we can only say that Emma is just lucky enough to have people who are willing to support her every day although her recent controversy that went down earlier this week left millions of fans speechless after they noticed that Emma was selling a personal Instagram DM for ten thousand dollars on her website yeah guys I don't know what level of scam this actually is at this point but from what people saw on her website shop Emma chamberlain.com she was actually charging 10K for a personal thank you note from her and well this situation you guys made millions of fans disappointed and upset as not only were they shocked at how Emma was charging for an Instagram DM but they were also surprised at how Emma hasn't learned anything about scamming her fans 10K all she did was get people obsessed with coffee and lip balm Fair she is now in the fashion world but still this is insane the way it's more expensive than Beyonce or Taylor tickets is so crazy the fact that she doesn't even have any sort of Talent OR skill either like she's nice and all but girl she's not making enough from laying in bed and talking to herself about how terrible her life is LOL as a result of all the backlash Emma and her team decided to respond to the controversy by closing their entire website and writing a message regarding the situation and while this message claims that the Instagram DM offer was never in intended to be active or purchased and that Emma herself had no knowledge of it at all there have been false and inaccurate claims that Emma Chamberlain was offering DMS in exchange for 10K as background in 2018 Kozak Emma's merch company was testing a prospective reward program related to Emma's merch without her knowledge in testing they created an outrageous never activated reward level that was not intended to be active or purchased these reward ideas were never run by Emma since they were not meant to be available for sale or reward but simply were intended for internal testing purposes this was never made public and certainly was never planned to be sold or purchased the test program was never discoverable on the main page or product listing site which is another reason that Emma had no knowledge of this with the internet's tendency to create false narratives around sensationalized stories we wanted to provide you with the truth first hand and from The Source the site is currently down for internal review anyways loves make sure to click on the

03/22/2023,Emma Chamberlain Gets Called Out ($10k dm addressed),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Bw4EjqkFoc,124-12,who would have thought that Emma Chamberlain the sister Squad member would now be hanging around amongst the Stars attending A-list celebrity events and being named the face of Brands I feel like nobody could have predicted the career that she's had and is still having as she continues to be one of the more successful influencers out there highly favored by a ton of Brands such as Lancome who just signed her as a brand ambassador in an attempt to appeal to a younger generation a girl known for her more relatable content who is anything but relatable these days but still manages to keep her fans close and keep this down to earth attitude except some were confused if that was still the case went over the weekend Emma Chamberlain found herself in some drama when someone discovers something on her merge website for her anything goes podcast now Emma doesn't really Post online very much anymore here and there she'll post a YouTube Vlog but for the most part besides sure anything goes podcast she's not really posting much anywhere so sometimes people will check on anything goes merch because she is active on the podcast and someone made a discovery that there was an option on that website to buy a DM from Emma and the cost of this was ten thousand dollars which sounds super extreme for someone who is known for being relatable plus Emma is big but ten thousand dollars for a DM from her I don't know about that I really don't so the tweet that I saw going around was sad to see Emma Chamberlain developed a God complex mindset sad to see this not even hating just genuinely disappointed and someone added a link to it and when I clicked on it it took me straight to her merch website and it was actually something that you could buy add to your cart like I was like what is going on because at first I thought it was like Photoshop something that was like a joke maybe it was an inside joke on her podcast something funny that she was doing I just did didn't think that this was something that was real and the other thing I was thinking was okay maybe this is something that she is offering but someone accidentally added a few extra zeros because it just did not seem like this is something she would be selling seriously plus when you went to her merch website it wasn't actually listed with the other merch products this was some sort of like hidden part of her website that you could only access if you specifically Googled it or if you had this link that I found on Twitter but tons of people were screenshotting it and it was going around and people were making jokes about it saying imagine paying off Emma Chamberlain DM monthly like a mortgage sorry babe we have to skip dinner tonight because I have Emma Chamberlain's DM payment tomorrow 10K for an Emma Chamberlain DM the world has truly gone crazy why is Emma Chamberlain charging 10K for an Instagram DM this is wild why is Emma Chamberlain charging 10K for a DM who is Emma Chamberlain I guess is the better question people on Tick Tock all also reacted to this wild price I mean everyone was just freaking out over it what the hell is Emma Chamberlain doing charging ten thousand dollars for a DM for ten thousand dollars Emma Chamberlain's assistant probably will send you one singular DM and then you have to live with the consequences of that decision for ten thousand dollars you can buy 57 pairs of Third Generation air pods which I would probably lose after a week or you could buy one and a half Chanel bags which is a much better investment because Chanel bags appreciate in value every year and a message from Emma Chamberlain does not carry your wallet unless you screenshot and then print out those messages and then origami them into some sort of bag anyways for those of you who are actually contemplating getting this DM I photoshopped one and it's a pretty good impression of what I believe you would get here you go I just saved you 10 grand I can't stop thinking about Emma Chamberlain having an option in her merch opt to buy a personalized DM from her on Instagram for ten thousand dollars so serious series two like you can literally look this up don't worry I mean if you still want a DM from Emma Chamberlain and you don't have ten thousand dollars to spare they have after pay it's only 902 a month for a year I feel like for the most part people on Twitter were taking this as like a joke and just confused meanwhile people commenting on her most recent photo on Instagram were being very harsh about it saying when you thought you're so important who even are you 10K for a DM that's not caring about your fans that's just caring about your pockets did the fame and money get to you sweetie there's your relatable girl the she is not like other celebrities girl there she is charging her fans ten thousand dollars for a miserable message LOL ten thousand dollars is so delusional and tone deaf shame on you charging 10K for a note I feel like a fool to have bought your coffee I'm going to donate the ones I have left you are insufferable for that 10K personal greeting like what so like I said it went all around the internet even Mr Beast join in on the conversation when somebody tweeted about it saying creators gone wild he said I'm gonna buy it and see what it says LOL but I don't think he actually could because a day later the website went under construction which made me think that this whole thing really was an error and people weren't actually supposed to see that at all and now Emma and her team are coming out to give a statement about what happened since it did kind of start a big conversation about Emma and I don't think that she wanted this narrative to continue about her that she has like this ego now where that Fame went to her head so in an exclusive statement to e-news she said a few days I started seeing comments asking why I was selling a DM for 10K I assume this was an online scam as I had never offered to sell a DM for any amount of money let alone 10K Emma says in her statement people were saying this was for sale on my merch site so I checked the site to see if it had been hacked and couldn't find anything out of the ordinary he says after doing her own digging Emma says that she reached out to the company behind her merge website to look deeper into the matter I immediately got in touch with my merch company Kozak who further investigated and put the site under construction while looking into the issue the company Kozak is the company that runs Emma merch site and they also put out a statement that went directly onto the website that explains the whole thing they said there have been false and inaccurate claims that Emma Chamberlain was offering DMS in exchange for 10K as background in 2018 Kozak Ms merch company was testing a prospective reward program related to Emma's merch without her knowledge in testing they created an outrageous never activated reward level that was not intended to be active or purchased these reward ideas were never run by Emma since they were not meant to be available for sale or reward but simply intended for internal testing purposes what we suspect is that data was activated and crawled by Google's SEO indexing system and discovered by an individual who then began spreading false information to press Outlets this was never made public and certainly was never planned to be sold or purchased the test program was never discoverable on the main page or product listing site which is another reason that Emma had no knowledge of this with the internet's tendency to create false narratives around sensationalized stories we wanted to provide you with the truth firsthand and from The Source the site is currently down for internal review Kozak Inc so that was a very big explanation as to what the heck happened here honestly a little confusing if you do not understand the creations of a website how to run a website like how to test products going up on a website that's a lot of information that they just throw at people and so some people were like you know were they actually going to launch this and they got a little backlash and they were like okay never mind let's create a little story to kind of maybe confuse people as to why we're not actually doing this but who knows what I will say is that if this is really the case that's super messed up for them to like trial something like this and not tell her about it especially with this kind of price tag they certainly should have made everything private that they were testing because clearly it's not a good look for her and I don't know how they could like run something without showing her first but it is good that they address this whole thing rather quickly and were able to sort of clear up that this wasn't something that they were moving forward with this isn't something that Emma had any knowledge of the thing that's quite unfortunate is that not everyone is going to see this response from both Emma and the website team Emma gave an exclusive statement to E news that yeah it's gonna get picked up and some people are going to see it but there's also a lot of people that aren't going to be getting that update especially if she doesn't post anything on her own Instagram since a lot of the more hateful comments like I said were on her Instagram with people just thinking that she's something that she is not because of all of this and with them saying that this was never something that was supposed to be seen by the public and that this was something that was never supposed to launch and Emma had no idea about it I mean it just makes her look really bad and that's kind of the sad part of the situation is that something happened that she didn't even know about and she's getting in trouble for her which makes me wonder if somebody had this come company is getting fired or if they're in some deep water because of this because they literally could have effed up her image at least in the eyes of a handful of people people definitely have like a bad taste in their mouth about Emma thinking that she is this egotistical little influencer now so that sucks that's for sure so that's what's going on with Emma no crazy merch to be bought at this time but some were thinking that let me know what you guys think about this whole thing that has been going around online and what do you guys think about the statement that they put out let me know your thoughts in the comments down below I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys thank you 
03/18/2023,Tana Mongaeu Is Messy (James Charles reunion),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2yG22vzf2Y,126-12,there's been a number of times where Tana Mojo has been upset with someone and had major drama with them talked a lot of crap about them but then later ended up hanging out with them again we've seen it with her friend Brooke Shane Dawson enderly every single EX that she's had including Bella Thorne she's literally ripped these people to shreds and then all of a sudden it's like nothing ever happens but the one person that Tana said multiple times that she would never make up with is James Charles who is one person you wish you never became friends with James Charles you win some elusive when I tell you I've burned enough bridges in the city I'm finally on I'm trying to be on a higher road but it's it's hard who do you still got beef with out there I guess my number one people know this obviously is James Charles oh yeah I'm gonna resolve that no he seems like a guy that's got a problem that's not going to be fixed I think yeah and I think honestly I have like I I don't really care to fit she's talked about him on most of the podcasts that she's gone on the podcast that she's also had and since the two of them used to be pretty close friends that's why the topic gets you know brought up so much because people are like what happened is there ever a chance and she's always like no never gross I don't like him I hate him all of this stuff and we were like we were friends didn't he get called out for like a million times and he's like Contin he just continues to do it and it's still just it's like such an abuse of power which I think is such a thing like if you're like you're power Dynamic to like you're young fans and like manipulate people and it's weird we were just friends for so long we like would hide so much like that from me and just do so much that in my opinion don't want to get sued um that in my opinion wasn't ethical or right and you know if I'm someone who says what you're doing is morally wrong it's going to be doing something wrong it's going to be a thing just out here like the oral police like you know of course self-righteous Tanner she's called him out for his behavior so much more than any other influencer honestly and to the point where people wondered how it was even possible that her friends could be friends with James with the way that she feels towards him Tana's friends Amari and Mario were close enough with James to film collabs with him and go on vacation for James's birthday and Brooke has been pictured with James a number of times and despite all that Hannah still kind of stood her ground that she wasn't going to make up with James and she felt how she felt about him most shocking two-faced influencer James Charles everywhere I mean the power Dynamic such a thing I think that with James Charles that really started to come into play where people during that time people began to actually hold people accountable for using their power against their fans and I think that it's crazy that it this year is the first year I thought it took way long for people to finally like start to recognize that that was happening and like and how wrong even as recent as January she was talking about James with Jeff this was when the Instagram DMS between him and someone from Tick Tock were going around and it was really embarrassing Tana couldn't wait to talk about it with Jeff like any opportunity that she can throw a dig at James she's going to take it okay look look look look what's this I'll read it I'll read it let's get right into the news sorry this one brings me like like joy and that's so me Joy James Charles is back at flirting making straight men uncomfortable the alleged screenshots reveal the benefits of being his boyfriend in one text James says it's a really lucrative role James used Instagram's vanish mode to attempt to prevent a leak this is just so funny to me okay obviously like it's wrong but I'm not sitting here like trying to actually come down on the logistics of it it's more so like if you're gonna do this like be less embarrassing obviously I will say this guy had to have been responding for it to like keep going down the thread and you know that's a benefit of the doubt I just wish the things he would say made me want to die less yeah and it's the same she's always done he's like not learning what the he's doing it's not a kid it's a straight guy like remember that a lot of his like cancellation was and is he underage no like a lot of his like cancel well I don't think so oh but he's just aggressively going after a guy that's like strike and not a boy she even quote tweeted the messages on Twitter saying new lock screen like she doesn't hide the fact that she will shade James at any opportunity that she has she in the past has even made fun of her friends when they did hang out with James jokingly having called Amari a traitor for going to James's birthday in Palm Springs uh you guys I told you guys I was at James's birthday I don't know what more you want he was at James you want traitor oh my God also poked fun adamari and Mario on that James birthday trip by stitching The Tick Tock that they posted and also commenting under their video saying so scary seriously like she was making it clear she was truly judging them for being friends with James okay you guys so if you don't know now you know I'm in Palm Springs right now for James Charles birthday I love Miss Jamie Charlie Camp Charles you know all that good stuff um but right now we just got presented with these banana bread shots banana bread shops it's like oat milk and like cookie and like banana and like I don't know it's supposed to be like really really good so we're gonna try but now it seems like something has changed and tana and James actually have made up and this is something that I did kind of maybe feel like it was going to be happening after she made up with Bella Thorne I was like I feel like Bella and her have this really crazy beef they have this crazy history she does not like Bella and then once they were friends again I was like she's probably gonna be friends with James even though she said all that stuff about James literally these are my notes from August 18th of 2022 and I literally wrote her with Bella proof she'll be friends with James again one day and look at that here we are 2023 a couple months later and appear apparently her and James are on good terms in a recent Jeff FM episode her and Jeff were talking about Lele pons wedding and James was also in attendance at this wedding in Miami and she says that they were there and decided to put the past behind them and be on good terms with each other um so we went to Lele ponsa's wedding in Miami James Charles is gonna be there and I just like kind of made up with him you know what I mean like not like we're never gonna be friends but like we have like a nice talk about just like being civil so I saw him we're like yeah slay and you're like ah you're like I just didn't I stuck to the plan you know I knew that we were gonna go there we do a pop culture podcast we talk about topics that aren't gonna sit well with some people if it's about them especially those types allegations so we gave our opinion on it and we knew that we were going there we're gonna cross paths and my whole thing is like I'm just gonna be cold and honestly I wouldn't be surprised if this already that I've been honestly but then you guys I guess said hello and it's all good now I yeah it's you know it's it's it's behind me being like an evil about it you know cool now it's my beef I guess you pass it off to me it's just crazy because she was so adamant about the fact that she would never never never be friends with James she didn't like him and she said so much about him and it's just it's just crazy I'm surprised that he would even want to talk to her at lele's wedding but with enough mutual friends I guess it was going to happen and they have stuff to talk about but yeah I mean I feel like maybe not surprising that Tana would change her mind but I'm surprised that James would be like yeah Tana's great let's you know mend things over but maybe he was tired of getting called out by her so much and this was maybe his plan to get her to stop I don't know but I will say that for a second after all of this I thought that they were hanging out like I thought that they were literally so close now that they were hanging out casually filming tick tocks together I was sisters spooked you guys but that wasn't actually the case but I'll tell you why I thought that it's because James posted a tick tock eating these candy covered grapes and said Amari was over at his house and he had made them the day before and Hannah posted this on her story the day before literally making the grapes so I was like did they hang out like did they both bring these groups over to James's but I feel like Amari probably just brought them over for James after he hung out with Tana but for a second I was like are they in the room together right now when I saw him holding that it was like Tina made those last night is Tana at his house right now do they make them together like what is going on but when I rewatched it I was like oh okay he said madamari made them last night so he wasn't hanging out with Hannah and Mari made them and he's over here filming a little YouTube video but definitely could see that happening in the future now that all this is going down and Coachella is right around the corner I'm sure they're both gonna be going and they're probably going to get a photo together oh my God I just can't picture it with all the stuff that she's said about him I feel like Tana was one of the only influencers left that was actually like still holding James accountable for his actions but I guess not I guess she is turning a new leaf and she is like I I don't know what you're talking about with James like I I never saw any of that it's just wild but I definitely want to know what you guys think about the fact that Hannah has gone in on James for years now and all of a sudden she's ready to put that in the past and the fact that James was okay with all that stuff I mean maybe not okay with all the stuff that she said but he was okay enough to forgive and forget and leave it in the past I guess I don't know let me know your thoughts in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys [Music] thank you 
03/17/2023,The Scary Truth Of Family Vlogging,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qhtAxFMVc,125-15,family channels especially on youtube are fun entertaining and interesting to watch but at what point does it become exploitation on the part of the parent family vlogging is very popular on youtube but for those who are unfamiliar with it let's give you a definition family vlogging is when parents film their family's day-to-day lives focusing on their children in particular and upload it as a vlog that is a virtual blog while it may appear to be a cute idea there are many debates about the challenges that come with this type of vlogging ordinarily vlogging entails a person choosing to share parts of their daily life and uploading them to the internet but when it comes to family vlogging however it is up to the parents to decide what content to upload or not upload from children's inability to control their internet presence to the highly questionable conduct of charging for access to your child it reflects a challenge that family vloggers mommy bloggers and influencers have all faced in recent years is it moral to use your child for likes with few laws governing it parents are free to record and post videos of their child for all to see and to make matters worse child labor laws did not even apply to youtube until the darkest side of family youtube channels was revealed consider the case of ryan kajai a 10 year old with over 30 million subscribers on youtube and over 50 million views he has become one of youtube's highest paid stars ryan came to popularity for his online show ryan's world which features him unboxing toys on camera for his pre-teen audience in 2019 his fame brought in more than 26 million dollars for his parents he was really only eight years old at the time and had over eight youtube channels and new videos being released almost every day it's no secret that kajai works around the clock whether that be playing with toys or doing interviews his parents reap the benefits of his efforts due to his minor status however many viewers have questioned the ethics of filming your child in order to earn advertising and sponsorship dollars when family vloggers are included in the mix the situation becomes even more troubling in the last five years family vlogging has exploded on youtube parents record their young children as they play go on vacation review toys and do other activities kids from all over the world tune in in large numbers which explains why there have been a number of incidents surrounding family vloggers in recent years one such incidents would be the stauffers case the staffers are youtubers who recorded their adoption journey and in 2020 they disclosed that they put up for adoption the child after making a lot of money off of him james who runs a successful car detailing youtube channel and his wife micah from ohio had been capturing their parenting journey on their youtube channel since 2014. they only became well known after they started documenting their adoption journey the staffers began the adoption process in 2017. michael stauffer announced that she and her husband were adopting a special needs child from china whom they would name huxley so this family decided to re-home huxley after creating more than 27 monetized videos cataloging the adoption promoting a fundraiser for huxley's special needs and charging five dollars per person to unlock a puzzle piece featuring huxley's face while the stauffer's tears moved a few fans the large majority condemned them for their irresponsible behavior but what do other influencers have to say about this sophie ross a freelance writer and copywriter who frequently publicizes and criticizes influencers behavior in an effort to hold public figures accountable accused stauffer of making adoption her brand and making herself the victim sophie ross tweeted extremely depressed reading about the influencer who raised funds to adopt a son made this her brand discovered he had special needs secretly re-homed him blocked people asking about him after her followers helped fund the adoption and put out a video making herself the victim ross went on to say that stauffer only posted the explanation video after her sponsors complained that the couple gave up their child after joyfully profiting off of him for years the thread received hundreds of likes and retweets and ross wasn't the only one who took to twitter to express their outrage others have criticized stauffer's parenting pointing out what they consider to be questionable content from the last few years here's a pic of two-year-old huxley with his hands duct taped by his parents my gut and jim stopper as punishment for sucking his thumb as a coping mechanism when their older children also sucked their thumbs and were never punished one twitter user wrote posting a screenshot from one of stauffer's vlogs not everyone wishes to have children and that's fine really as people choose not to have children for a variety of reasons some of which are very much valid and should be respected however if you decide to have children it is your responsibility as a parent to raise that child whether or not that child has special needs the stauffers not only did they choose to have children they chose to adopt a child but then not just any child but one with special needs seems to me like they only wanted him for the sympathy that comes with him which thereby results in more views more clicks and as we all know more money but once they realize they can't cope with it anymore off you go poor huxley and this can be seen all over the internet with family vlogs children are being exploited every day all in the name of content remember when singer pink expressed concern about the sexualization of teen star piper raquel on the internet and pointed the fingers at the parents after piper raquel posted youtube videos and instagram photos in which she posed in a bikini how many kids like piper raquel are being exploited by their parents pink wrote on twitter and at what point do the rest of us say this isn't okay for a 13 year old to be posing in a bikini whilst her mother takes the photo for those of you who don't know piper raquel has over 8 million youtube subscribers and over 5 million instagram followers her channel is described in her bio as a place to watch crazy challenges such as boyfriend challenges crush challenges and 24 hour challenges pink has been tuning in the 8th grader couldn't believe it i don't think pink has ever seen one of my youtube videos because if she did she'd see it's just my friends and me having fun and acting like ourselves raquel told today parents the content we make is the kind of stuff anyone can watch tiffany piper's mother responded to today by saying she's just trying to help her daughter achieve her goals and that piper has always had a strong love of performing piper who noted that pink was 14 years old when she joined the band basic instinct went on to say they're only sexual if you view us that way why was it okay for her to follow her dreams but not okay for me to follow mine in an instagram post courtney stodden defended singer pink's comments by criticizing the parents of popular youtuber piper raquel it's hard for children to separate attention they receive online from predatory behavior from adults courtney wrote it's our responsibility as a society to step up and protect our kids as much as we can from falling victim to this cycle of digital grooming as adults we can see what they can't courtney may not have mentioned raquel or pink in the text of the caption but it is made clear whom the caption was referring to with the hashtags hashtag piperocal and hashtag pink while also tagging the songstress three thumbnails from 14 year old piper raquel's youtube videos were reportedly removed for violating the platform's child safety policy youtube drew thumbnails from the videos titled my boyfriend reacts to fashion nova swimsuit haul body shaming prank my boyfriend walked in on me and wearing a hot outfit then leaving him cute reaction cat ten barge senior reporter on insider's digital culture desk took to her twitter page fourteen-year-old piper raquel and her mother are defending themselves after pink called her content exploitative cat wrote piper said pink must not watch her youtube videos not so long after this piper's mother tiffany smith was sued 11 former members of piper raquel's piper squad have filed a lawsuit against the teen's mother and her boyfriend according to the lawsuit tiffany and her boyfriend are accused of physical emotional verbal and sexual abuse as well as financial exploitation tiffany smith is also accused of being sexually inappropriate with the children but more on this in the next video i hope you found this video educational and entertaining so for now i recommend that you double check that youtube content that you're watching is appropriate for both parties don't get me wrong some children's content on youtube is completely alright and children are all over so it'd be absurd to suggest that we remove all of them from youtube rather make sure that the youtubers you're watching are decent parent role models sprinkle of glitter philip defranco and lasercorn are just a few examples these youtubers also include their children in some of their videos while also ensuring the safety of their children hopefully with both viewers and content producers working on this issue these questions concerning family vlogging on youtube will be resolved in the near future if you'd like to watch more videos like this or want to know more about piper raquel's mother tiffany smith's lawsuit click the link in the description below and click on the notification bell to get notified when we release new content 
03/17/2023,Jeffree Star Attacks Hailey Bieber Brand,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl1kd2UfWLw,127-17,Jeffree Star is in his join the drama era and just like the Michaela mascara drama he decided to join in on this Selena Gomez versus Haley Bieber drama even though I feel like a lot of people are ready to just move on Jeffrey had to wait for his order to ship before he could even join the conversation he posted a tick tock showing Haley Bieber's skincare brand wrote and said that this package had arrived in the mail for him while he was away and he was going to review her brand well he didn't even review it he just took a giant dump on her brand without even opening a single product before he even opened the box honestly uh hi guys this came in the mail so I just got back from Paris I've been catching up here at the star Yak Ranch and life has been really busy so we are fully back to reviewing makeup and this came in the mail okay so the packaging is so boring and then I open it up and girl she literally looks like she wants to die like the focus oh my God that face is like why did I do this why did I create a skincare brand so when you're privileged and you use daddy's money and you'd never work a day in your life I guess this is what we're doing okay you guys I don't even know what to say this is so boring I'm not even trying to be funny for once this is what she's giving in this house we are team Selena and we are a team and not bullying anyone so we're gonna skip today's review wait she doesn't even deserve a pig trash can and just like Shawn Mendes said bye and it was very obvious that Jeffrey was doing this because people are currently hating on Haley right now but he literally supported her brand in order to make this video and that has me cracking up like this isn't some PR box that he's holding up no Jeffrey literally went to her website paid the money to film this video of himself literally they're rubbing her products into the trash not even attempting to review them properly he honestly probably went through the trash and recovered them after he was done filming this video but this this video just was so intense and the part that he's like claiming he doesn't like bullies had me absolutely laughing because I feel like a lot of YouTubers probably also laughed hearing him say this like Jeffree Star talking about Haley Bieber being a bully like Jeffrey starts we know Jeffrey's history here like he does not want to talk about bullying is bad I mean there were a lot of people that were afraid of him at times in their career on YouTube and even Shane who is super close with him has said that Jeffrey scares him sometimes but Jeffrey's claiming he doesn't stand for bullying no Jeffrey was pretty proud of this Tick Tock though and he even posted it on Instagram telling people to go watch it that's how proud he was okay I just did a review on Tech talk of Road skin by Miss Haley if you don't have tick tock you're missing out but then people noticed that the video was all of a sudden gone like poof Tick Tock Side Up Jeffrey you're seeing success uh we gotta remove it and flagged his video some people thought that Jeffrey deleted the video and were confused someone said Jeffrey did you delete that video he said I would never delete it says under review now what the hell another said they took the road review down and no that was the best one and he said why did Tick Tock remove it another said the Haley video got removed and I'm so sad I was in tears laughing and he said it won't even let me appeal like literally people were loving this Jeffrey this Jeffrey that was throwing Haley stuff in the trash and Jeffrey was also taking the time to say that he was going to be reviewing Selena's brand this weekend someone asked him if he was going to and he literally said this weekend so I'm pretty sure that when all the stromos going down Jeffrey said let me go on both of their websites place an order One's Gonna Be me going off on Haley and the other one's actually gonna be a review viewer it's just funny how the video got taken down by Tech talker it was flagged by Tick Tock shall they say for bullying probably and Jeffrey's talking about no bullying in his own video but he ended up jumping on Instagram stories once again to talk about the fact that Tick Tock took down his video oh a lot of you just alerted me that my review is gone I just logged on The Tick Tock and it says under review I've never had this happen to a video so I don't know what that means I mean I do but like what what's what's offensive my honesty did Haley's PR team already attack it what's happening and Jeffrey asking if his review was a little too honest cracks me up because he didn't even review the product like he barely even opened the packaging he just reacted to it and I truly don't know why Jeffrey would think that this was a good idea for him I mean I guess maybe in some sort of a way it was because people were loving it for him but obviously he's enough reviews and attention and a ton of people do that but Jeffrey has been priding himself on being someone who doesn't do biased makeup reviews and I know he did this to try and poke fun at the drama and it wasn't like a serious review but I don't know this whole thing just seemed like a yikes like he really came for Michaela when she wasn't being honest in her reviews and he was like I'm back I heard the makeup Community is calling me because there's some fraudulence going on and he was really priding himself on the fact that nobody could pay him or nobody could make him say anything nice about their brand but I feel like Jeffrey knows that if he's team Selena then of course people are going to love him and if he were to say something nice about Haley's brand people probably wouldn't like him and so he's really playing with the drama right now and that's not very unbiased makeup review isn't now Jeffrey but obviously Jeffrey did not care about how he was coming across when posting this and the only thing that he really seemed to care about is that people couldn't see it anymore since it was taken down but I guess he ended up appealing to take down and somehow Tick Tock put it back up for him and the comments you guys on the original Tick Tock were literally living for this energy from Jeffrey Lake more than I thought because originally the only comments I was seeing were people sad that it was taken down but now I was seeing the comments of the original reactions people had to this review and they said this is too iconic the way I screamed when it hit the bottom of that can this is how you stand up to Mean Girls this is the best Jeffree Star review ever no way he just threw it out iconic he did not not and someone literally said to Jeffrey you should ask Selena Gomez to let you do her makeup please like the fact that people think Selena would sit down with Jeffrey right now is wild this is everything she's against right now Selena does not want people to be attacking Haley she wants people to be mindful of others mental health so I don't think she'll be sitting down with Jeffrey anytime soon but also in general like why would she their brands don't align at all like the messaging that she's trying to send it's just not it's just not Jeffrey at all but I really can't believe how Jeffrey has managed to have this sort of comeback and is getting this level of love from Tick Tock and it only really does seem to be on Tick Tock because other people on social media weren't really living for this review quite as much as his fans on Tick Tock but he did not care he was standing by what he said in that video saying on Twitter honesty is a b sometimes get over it and now that his video is back up you can also see the caption on his video and it says trying out Road skin by the bully and mean girl at Haley Bieber the bully and mean girl it's almost like Jeffrey is talking about himself here but something I wanted to mention in this is that people were under the impression that Jeffrey was sent PR by Haley and was doing some sort of power move by throwing it away like I said earlier Jeffrey bought this like he had to have this is not Haley's PR packaging and why would Jeffree Star be receiving PR from Haley Bieber good morning everyone Hi how are you yesterday girl they tried it they tried to take my review down but um no Tick Tock is amazing they're so up and the reviews up if you've seen it you've seen it I said what I had to say what I don't like is anyone trying to flip it on me Jeffrey you're bullying the bully I just did an honest review and I never said I got PR I bought that with my own money and it's also a tax write-off so it's basically free um but I love buying makeup I buy stuff all the time I've been buying stuff to review for 10 years so I guess some Twitter account said that it was a PR kit girl I never I never claimed that stop it I just think it's so amusing how hard people ride for these people like you think Haley gives up for any of y'all she right Neil she ain't messaging y'all and she don't give a me because she's stacked to misting um but no I think that she just genuinely looks miserable the skincare is awful um and it just looked like a shoebox so I was like I guess when you have no creativity and a lot of money and you've never worked hard that's what it's giving so it's no hate it's just the truth and I think that's exactly why he made this video so much later than the whole Selena Haley drama because he had to wait for this to get shipped out to him and the timing of him also doing a Selena review like he bought this and he bought them at the same time that's why he's doing the review this same weekend that he posted this Tick Tock of the Heelys brand in other news I am free all weekend in Wyoming and I'm going to be reviewing rare Beauty finally I know the timing's a little bizarre um but I was gone for a week in Paris I tried to get a lot of reviews done and girl it didn't happen I got a few done so I have a lot of catching up to do but this whole thing is giving me the time him and Shane bought all of Kylie's skin care brand except that time he actually did use the products I still can't believe he bought this just to throw it away and didn't even try it but I want to know what you guys think about Jeffrey going so Above and Beyond in The Dramatics for this Tick Tock in order to get into the drama somehow were you living for it like The Tick Tock comments or did you think it was just ridiculous let me know in the comments I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys right 
01/18/2023,Mr. Beast Cancelled Over This,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO5tKwlvb0I,106-15,Mr Beast is making it clear that he wants to take over the chocolate bar Market with his brand feastables but the way he's recently been going about it has been pretty controversial to say the least Mr B's critics are furious with the YouTuber after a recent tweet he made where he put out a call for his followers to help clean up displays at local Walmarts and wreck his competitors such as Hershey's I think it's pretty clear that Mr Beast is really trying to take his chocolate bar brand to the next level and boy do people have a lot of things to say about it Mr Beast whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson recently took to his Twitter and he thought it'd be a good idea to have asked his fans to help clean up the feastable bar displays in their local stores some being their local Walmarts in a recent Twitter post Mr Beast astus bands to arrange feastables in Walmarts and help clean up the presentation so that it looks somewhat presentable and nice hoping that you know know people would buy them he also said that he is building a team to help arrange his products at retail stores so that it doesn't really look messy all over the shelves a lot has changed for creators and influencers over these last few years I mean we've seen many social media influencers launching their own unique Brands and many of them have even come to reach incredible Heights being stopped at places like Walmart and this idea probably would have never crossed these influencers mind however Mr Beast is calling for his fans to lend a hand and kind of just help him out with his brand and his feastable bars in retail stores we all know Mr Beast has been growing his Empire and he's come out with multiple different business ventures in early 2022 Mr Beast unveiled his chocolate bar brand called feasibles and since its launch it's even made its way to almost every single Walmart store across the US which is pretty crazy to think about I mean we have to remember like Mr Beast started out as a YouTuber and now he's made his way to Walmart stores more recently though Mr Beast has been asking his fans to help clean up the displays in their local Walmart and also move competitors out of his way while they're at it and I'm talking competitors like Hershey's this has sparked a lot of backlash as you guys can expect and we're gonna discuss what people have to say about this but the other day Mr Beast published a tweet saying I need your help next time you see beastables in Walmart and soon to be new retailers if you could clean up the presentation and make it look better that made me very happy I'm building a team to do this routinely just need help in the short term he even said in a now deleted tweet that he wouldn't complain if his fans would have moved some Hershey's Bars while they're in their cleanup process clearly showing his competitiveness and boldness with this by kind of shading a big name chocolate brand that's been in the game for years AKA Hershey's in the now deleted tweet he wrote and while you're at it if you want to maybe move some Hershey's Bars and make sure feastables has plenty of space I wouldn't complain one of his followers tweeted sharing a photo of him actually going out of his way to arrange Mr BEAST's chocolate bars for free at his nearby Walmart store I was at Walmart and saw your chocolate bar I fixed them properly anything for the team I even bought the chocolate sea salt one hashtag team Mr Beast anyways there were actually people going out of their way for what the other majority of people are quoting as buying into this unethical capitalism and not a lot of people are here for this free labor that they're doing for Mr Beast especially considering the fact that he is super rich and that he could have easily hired someone to do this for him for his company right off the bat yeah Mr Beast her candy bars are all messed up I'm a professional I'll fix them let's take a look s good again sure to the top there we go bam we need to buy one too we'll get it check out I want to mess it up now okay 21. let's see um where's the crispy quinoa crunch all right we'll get this one there we go initially Mr B started his brand feastables as a chocolate bar company but it has since expanded into cookies and even merchandise back in January he tweeted saying how he eventually wants to build these Brands and eventually be able to sell parts of them for billions of dollars so that he can give away billions in future videos he said I want to build feastables Beast Burger Etc and eventually be able to sell parts of them for billions of dollars so I can give away billions in future videos these next few years will be an interesting experiment maybe I should IPO feastables and Beast burger while they're relatively small so you guys can share in the growth feel pretty confident we can easily 100x the revenue we are doing but I don't know if that made my life too stressful or not since asking for help from his followers some have of course Taken part causing others to come for Mr Beast saying things like he's flat out taking advantage of his fans over on Twitter there's been a lot of mixed responses about this situation and here's what many people had to say Mr Beast just unlocked a new form of capitalism I hate it here it's fascinating to watch the stage of capitalism where people are honored to do free labor for rich people that don't care about them because they feel some kind of connection and loyalty like a dog wanting a tree only the tree is an imagined feeling of connection some people were even going as far as to saying that they would go out of their way to instead mess up with the shelves saying things like I'm totally going to mess with this guy's stuff if I see it on the shelves a storm of his fans have already begun helping out Mr Beast with many sharing their process of cleaning up the rocks and shelves of his chocolate bars at retail stores many are sharing pictures and videos and others are just calling them out saying that they're doing free labor for nothing organizing shelves for free in a store you don't even work in is actually insane Behavior we were just in Walmart and noticed this display needed some fixing there's others that have been taking this situation maybe a little too far saying things like at Mr Beast I will continue destroying your chocolate displays until you pay me one hundred thousand dollars now Mr Beast has been responding to a lot of these people who were actually going out of their way to clean the shelves and he was just responding with things like heart emojis and things like that but a lot of people weren't here for it because they were just saying that his fans were being taken advantage of and just doing free labor for someone who's extremely rich anyways guys this has been the whole situation going on with Mr Beast and how he recently got canceled over this on Twitter I definitely want to know what you guys think about the situation in the comments down below I love you guys so much and as always I'll see you all in the next video thank you [Music] foreign 
01/18/2023,Tana Mongeau Calls Out James Charles,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgBmwVtBQ5A,90-14,James Charles kicked the year off in drama when a Tick-Tock user posted his James Charles experience and shared DMS he received from James where he is flirting with this guy admitting he knows this guy is straight and pitching the benefits of being with him he also shared a very interesting video of James pitching reasons why they should FaceTime with each other annoying or like oh my God David you're being annoying you're like oh my God three of those are completely different like emotions that you cannot see through text you only get to actually experience those through a FaceTime caller through being in person even over the phone you still miss out on things because you're visiting somebody's facial expressions right so because you refuse to hang out with people or because you refuse to FaceTime you're not allowing people to actually get to know you as a human being and that's a massive a massive problem whenever it comes to being in a relationship with somebody I think had it been anyone else people would have felt bad that these messages were exposed but because of his past people weren't really wanting to feel bad for him especially with him admitting that this guy was straight and he knew that in a video message so obviously being that you are straight I would assume that you don't know a lot about like the gay community this has been a conversation for years now and James has always said people lie to him about their interests lied about their ages switched up on him and the issue that people have had with James is feeling like he's getting himself in these situations and then once sympathy and people seemingly have had it with him and feel like he hasn't learned from his past people have told him many times you just honestly can't be dming people on your main account you shouldn't be looking for people on Instagram social media all of this stuff because they're gonna see your follower account and they are going to probably use you so let's be careful and with the recent drama people just feel like he is not being careful even though he said he was never gonna do this all again he was not gonna get himself in these types of situations I was allowing myself to be so easily accessible to literally anybody who wanted to give me attention and have a conversation for five minutes because I was so delusional and thinking that the conversation can't hurt maybe it'll actually lead to me finding you know the one he said that he does not like being taken advantage of for who he is used for clout and you would think that he would be more cautious because he wouldn't want things like that happening again and again and again and again but here we are the messages that James sent were all revealed in this guy's Tick Tock video that he post posted and it revealed this big long pitch that James had sent to him as his way of flirting but basically saying how beneficial it is to date him including things like living my 10 million dollar house travel opportunities all of this stuff which just sounds like the opening of the door to being used if this is you know what you're trying to sell yourself as now once this started going viral the reactions came in from the public that is for sure and tana Mojo took to Twitter when this came out and she had to show you James she said new lock screen tana and James used to be friendly but in the last couple of years Tana hasn't wanted to associate with James and has been really clear that she doesn't support him in any way and there's a lot of times where Tana will talk about someone and then you'll see her at a party with them but not with James Tana has not changed her stance on James at all and we were it's like such an abuse of power which I think is such a thing like if you're like your power Dynamic to like your young fans and like manipulate people and it's weird we were just friends for so long we like would hide so much like that from me and just do so much that in my opinion don't want to get sued um that in my opinion wasn't ethical or right and you know if I'm someone who's thinking what you're doing is morally wrong it's going to be doing something wrong it's got to be a thing like just out here like the moral police self-righteous Tanner here and he even knows that she doesn't like him he's mentioned it in a tick tock before then he knows that Tana does not like him put her name on your head and you have to guess who it is Tana Mojo okay how did you know that Michael if I took your phone right now look to your only fans SpongeBob memes and [ __ ] out of my house and it's super interesting because in the recent years James has actually become super good friends with nearly every single one of Tana's friends but still Tana has avoided him and shades him continuously and doesn't seem to be ending this Feud anytime soon and so of course when all this was going down with James A lot of people were just feeling like this is super embarrassing for James so Tana was like yup this is my opportunity I'm going to laugh at him and she brought the shade she could not hold back the excitement that she had for sharing this story with Jeff on a recent Jeff FM podcast Tiana brought the screenshots of the messages between James and the sky and she was just so hyped to get into the topic okay look look look look what's this I'll read it I'll read it let's get right into the news sorry this one brings me like like joy and that's so [ __ ] it's so funny Tana took this as an opportunity to really Rel position the fact that someone she doesn't like was being called out and she found the whole thing so funny because of how James was flirting in these messages James Charles is back at flirting making straight men uncomfortable the alleged screenshots reveal the benefits of being his boyfriend in one text James says it's a really lucrative role James gives Instagram's vanish mode to attempt to prevent a leak this is just so funny to me okay obviously like it's wrong but I'm not sitting here like trying to actually come down on the logistics of it it's more so like if you're gonna do this like be less embarrassing Tana did want to take the time and say that this guy obviously had to be showing interest in James back for him to be replying so much but she just found this whole thing just so funny still and I will say that there's so many people that also said will this guy obviously had to be talking to James in a flirty way in order for James to respond and yeah I mean probably but the fact that he said he's Straight Like That should be clue number one is we need to get out of the situation James obviously I will say this guy had to have been responding for it to like keep going down the thread and you know that's a benefit of the doubt I just wish the things he would say made me want to die less like I just don't understand how James sent this guy a video acknowledging that he knows he's straight and just thought to himself that you know okay I can change him like no no no that's not the mentality that's not no that's not okay that's not right let's walk away because this isn't the first time that something like this has happened James with you and he said that he doesn't want to be an experiment he doesn't want to be used he doesn't want any of that like James has literally made a video sat down and addressed exactly what he's done wrong in the past and how he's going to prevent it going forward but yet we're still back in the same place once again I recognize that this is my own fault I wish more than anything I could go back in time and stop myself from making all those jokes about straight guys years ago and talking about dating and how I was single and how I wanted a boyfriend so badly like I wish more than anything that I kept that private and fortunately at this point there's nothing that I can do about that other than just be better moving forward so he should definitely hear those words I'm straight and keep it moving keep it moving they are playing games with you and even Jeff was saying in this episode with Tiana just how ridiculous it is that this keeps happening with James where he is getting called out and exposed to talking to people online it just happens over and over and over again yeah and it's the same she's always done he's like not learning what the [ __ ] he's doing it's not a kid it's a straight guy like remember that a lot of his like cancellation was is he underage no like a lot of his like cancel well I don't think so oh but he's just aggressively going after a guy that's like Jeff even admits that he unfollowed James because he just doesn't support him in the things that he's been called out for over the years can you read your DMs with James Charles right now yeah I unfollen him after this past week because I realized I was following him and all this stuff and your beef with him you know we got each other's back we ride together and it's bad you're doing the same you've been doing for the past three years and all Santa could do was just laugh at James for this whole thing she was just enjoying every single little bit about this and all he messaged the guy back after was go yourself David wait what the guy's name is David but like sorry TW um the guy's name is David and after the guy exposed him all James said was go [ __ ] yourself David wow damn he is salty huh I guess I don't know so clearly Tana is not any closer to wanting to clear the air between her and James even though they have all these mutual friends it just clearly isn't going to happen and I certainly want to know what you guys think about what Tana had to say about this the fact that she was literally on cloud nine hearing that James was being called out for these embarrassing messages so let me know what you guys think in the comments below I love you guys so much and I will talk to you in the next video bye guys [Music] 
01/13/2023,TikToker Reveals New Details About James Charles Predator Behavior..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU_6c48acmc,89-14,here we go again with James Charles getting exposed for the 20th time this decade for pressuring straight men into dating him but this time you guys the situation took a shocking turn and I believe many people are sliding with Chase before we get into the situation that went down with James and how he ended up getting canceled and saved by the internet all at once I do want to make it clear first that the majority of the information and screenshots mentioned in today's video have been proven to be true so if there's any fabricated evidence included in the video then make sure to point it out in the comments below without further Ado guys let's just jump in and touch on the details surrounding James's recent drama and how it led to him getting canceled again it's crazy how the past few years have been really bad for James I mean this man literally had his Peak twice in his career which is very rare for an influencer because he went from Gaining millions of views with the sister Squad to getting canceled by toddy Westbrook and Jeffree Star and after a year of him trying to gain back the attention he had James managed to find a way to earn more money and Views by hanging out with the hype house but all good things had to come to an end later on after James got canceled for pressuring straight men and hitting up underage boys this all started after an underage tick tocker who decided to post a video on Tick Tock about James and how he tried hitting him up on Snapchat despite knowing that he was underage at the time I was excited because he's my biggest influence I went into the bathroom and I guess he saw the bathroom light so he started making the conversation very soon it made me really uncomfortable not only did the explicit photos from him but he even revealed that James knew he was a minor and continued flirting with him and y'all this situation made James get canceled immediately off of social media without having any pure evidence that the victim was being truthful but of course we always have to believe the victim first in any situation and I'm glad that people actually did this time because tons of victims decided to come forward months later to expose James in multiple videos and in those videos not only did the victims reveal how James tried forcing them to send explicit pictures despite being straight but they also exposed him for trying once again pressure miners as well just check these out excuse me [Music] at this point people were sick and tired of James constantly using his ego to pressure Street men and miners to send him explicit pictures and that's how the cancel James Charles movement began on social media thousands of people came to the conclusion that James Charles should be wiped away from the internet immediately this started a huge hate train towards James that left him with no choice but to take accountability since he tried at first to get away with multiple accusations that almost ruined his career but this time it was more serious than before after the entire internet went against him to the point where he lost tons of brand deals and sponsorships just from those accusations of course James took a break at first to make people forget about him for a while but then he tried returning to social media afterwards with YouTube videos of him holding himself accountable and having an open conversation with his fans about his behavior surprisingly none of these videos served Justice for James at all since people were already bored of James manipulating his fans and playing the victim all over again but I feel like what made James wake up and realize that he had lost everything was when morphe AKA The Makeup Company James had a contract with decided to drop James out of their contract this news made James take a long break on social media after he realized how his career could officially be done but for some reason people felt that James needed to hold more accountability for his past actions as well after they resurfaced tons of old videos of James justifying Ophelia and showing his interest towards minors more than people his age so the thing is for me I'm 21 but like I said I have the mentality of a 40 year old yeah so for me like I'm much more mentally and emotionally mature than a lot of people my age I'm not physically attracted to older guys which sucks like I would date like the absolute youngest like 18 19. another situation happened months later with James after a straight influencer decided to expose James for asking to send his Snapchat username and while despite how the influencer refused to reply to James James was able to use his Snapchat username trade nudes with him and blackmail him on Instagram that he would leak his nudes and in which the influencer went on Tick Tock to clarify that James got the wrong Snapchat username I thought it was funny that he asked for my Snapchat so I said I'll make a little funny video out of it you know I wasn't that deep so then I guess he unblocks me and he sends me those text messages basically trying to Blackmail me you know first off homie I had tattoos on both of my hands if that was me in those pictures you would be able to see my tattoos and second mine don't look like that you feel me that's not mine dog three if I had added you on Snapchat that would have meant that at some point I would have accepted your DM and gave you my Snapchat so why is your DM still in my request Why didn't it go straight through that's cause I never answered you yeah it's crazy how not only James got trolled by another person instead of the actual influencer he wanted to trade picks with but he even exposed himself for trying to Blackmail the influencer and leak his fake nudes you you cannot deny the fact that James was right in the head while all this was going down and I truly believe that he needed to face real consequences for his actions but the next story I'm going to tell you will probably make you have mixed opinions over these accusations towards James and here's why earlier this week James Charles started trending on social media again with thousands of tweets being made about he was being a creep online again and how he tried to hit up other straight men so I've tried to investigate the situation to find out what really happened and y'all here's the full story basically a tick talker called David decided to go on Tick Tock this week to show proof that James followed him and asked for his age in the DMS and just to keep in mind David followed James back on Tick Tock after he followed him so keep that information in mind anyways shortly after they both followed each other on Tick Tock they began texting on Instagram by using vanish mode and of course David decided to leak screenshots of James talking about the benefits of being his boyfriend it's a really lucrative role it's called my boyfriend requirements 6-2 plus must love escape rooms horror movies and cuddling big armpit here and an occasional FaceTime call the salary is zero dollars but it's a good job offer I think perks include a cute boyfriend with a great personality and huge acts free living in a 10 million dollar house in La fun travel opportunities good head and more I'm still not sure whether James was being sarcastic in those texts or not but based on what I've seen I think James was being 100 serious in those messages now here's where things got worse because despite how David was trying so hard to expose James for being weird in his DMS he still wasn't providing any type of shocking information that could lead James to getting canceled until David decided to pull the receipts and post a video confirming that James knew about him being straight beforehand so obviously being that you are straight I would assume that you don't know a lot about like yeah this honestly looks very bad for James considering the fact that he has stated before now that he will not hit up straight men again after his cancellation happened in 2021 but here he is again trying to hit up another straight man anyways David continued posting more proof of James pressuring him to do a FaceTime call and y'all just take a look at how weird and uncomfortable it gets so if I'd be like oh my God David you're annoying over text right you don't know if I'm saying like oh my God David you're being annoying or like oh my God David you're being annoying you're like oh my God David you're gonna be [ __ ] annoying all three of those are completely different like emotions after this David posted more text between him and James where James was seen getting jealous over a girl that David followed on Instagram and to make this even worse James even mentioned his body count to David and that he just lost his competition with her this is all just crazy information to receive about James especially since he's been known for being egocentric and self-confident but based on these texts it proved that James is nothing but a lonely person who desperately needs a person in his life anyways after all these videos that David posted went viral and gained tons of attentions on social media David proceeded to post a nude screenshot of James telling him to go f himself following the backlash he received over the situation and in my opinion I feel like something isn't adding up in this entire situation to me it just seems that these straight men enjoy leading James on and engaging in the conversations just to expose him you cannot deny the fact that these straight men weren't entertaining James in those DMS for James to write such a thing and be so comfortable with them in those texts I mean David and so many other straight men who have come out to expose James have rarely shown their own messages they've sent to James in those conversations and this just proves that these straight men are only entertaining conversations with James Charles just to post it for cloud I cannot believe y'all made me defend James Charles at one point in his career but someone had to say it because neither James nor the rest of the media is doing its job correctly just read some of the comments that people loved about this entire conversation I have a hard time believing that these men James Charles be dming don't like the attention like you can easily block that man James only fought in this specific situation is being corny and chasing after straight men however this guy is obviously leading James on to blast him online like this is homophobia plain and simple and this is why I don't often talk to people from online because few weirdos are out for clout that you want to set someone up to expose them this is a violation not a leak it should be illegal and I can't wait for the law to catch up to our current technology anyways loves make sure to click on the tab above for more juicy videos on these influencers 
01/07/2023,The Dark Side Of The Norris Nuts..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7rgCs1jjWo,86-16,being an influencer is becoming more of a popular career path as millions of people join social media each day but as the industry had become very saturated some people go to extreme lengths to pull in views so that they can make their day-to-day lives their full-time income but when you bring your children into your career by creating a social media presence that revolves around your family there is a point where some of these influencers go far past the point of sharing their children online to actually exploiting them and in today's video we're going to be diving into one of the families that have caused huge outrage and been hit with some serious allegations from animal neglect to child exploitation so let's take a look at the Dark Truth behind Norris nuts the Norris nuts are a family YouTube channel that have become one of the most successful in their genre they have well over 6 million subscribers and pull in millions of views on pretty much all of their videos that they make the channel revolves around the six children in the family Sabre who's the oldest child then Rocky biggie Naz disco and charm who's the youngest child at just three years old Justin Norris who is well known for competing at the Olympics in 2000 for swimming and his wife Brooke besides Justin having somewhat of a celebrity status at one point for being an athlete it is actually the eldest sibling Sabre who's the reason behind the family's rising to popularity she was even invited onto the Ellen show for her talents in sports this prompted Justin and Brooke to create a channel where they could let their viewers into their daily life the Channel's content is mainly split into two topics one being Vlogs which show the things that the family get up to and also challenges where the North's nuts are set to do various different tasks like seeing who can eat more cupcakes or compete in challenges like whoever stays in the bathroom the longest wins a thousand dollars obviously nothing seems to be inherently shocking about the channel it seems like nothing more than parents having fun with their children in front of an online audience however when you look further into their videos you can see that not everything is as innocent and as playful as it may appear over the course of their career on YouTube Justin and Brooke have come under Fire for various different reasons however one of the main things that they receive criticism for is how invasive they can be at times towards their children if you were to binge through all of the Channel's content you will notice that on multiple occasions the children are filmed crying and this is usually put into the thumbnail of the videos to grab attention this has obviously raised concerns from viewers as not only do they find this to be super disingenuous but also tons of people have pointed out how weird it is that in a moment when your child is clearly in distress what reason you would have to shove a camera in their face and post their meltdowns online for anything apart from attention and money in this video posted to their Channel Sabri lost a skateboarding competition and becomes extremely upset due to putting so much pressure on herself and the entire time her mother Brooke keeps the camera in her face capturing every tear and then proceeds to post it online for Millions see a small child in a vulnerable state the Legends don't care they have someone is like oh so he was going to do well so he was going to really do well all the Legends are there guys and they were all like they all knew it they all knew our song and they all knew about you Legends and I felt like because I knew they let everyone I'll let you down by not winning even though it is completely normal to cry I can't imagine being the age I am now and knowing that millions of people I have literally never met have seen me basically break down on camera in a Reddit thread discussing the Norris nuts one user wrote used to watch them and uh the video where they humiliate Biggie and shove the camera all up in his face while he sobs is just nope nope nope and another pointed out how strange and unconventional the kids lives were saying I feel bad for these kids they are not growing up normal and it's evident through their personalities this brings me on to the next point of concern for a whole lot of people who have seen the family's videos which is the norse's parenting and how they raise their children now now I know that everyone raises their children differently and you shouldn't assume that the way you raise your own children is better than anyone else's however in this case some of the things that have been seen in the Norris nuts videos have been interesting to say the least besides all six children basically having no privacy as they are being filmed and made to create content nearly 24 7. they also seem pretty isolated from the world outside of their tiny domestic bubble the Norris nuts are homeschooled which Justin and Brooke have always weirdly dodged or comically brushed off any questions when this topic is brought up however none of the kids in the family seem to have any friends besides each other they obviously don't get a social life at school because they aren't educated at home but despite vlogging their life pretty extensively none of the Norris nuts seem to have any form of social life that doesn't include their parents or other siblings instead of making friends in the real world they're kept in a routine of making content and kept stimulated by competing for cash prizes and challenges staged by their parents and on top of this none of the children are allowed a mobile phone or social media besides Sabri who has only recently been allowed to have her own phone at the age of 17. all of this just seems like it would be really detrimental to the development of their social skills when they become adults but this isn't all they have also been called out with allegations of sexualizing their children particularly Sabre for Content this is because of videos such as this one which is titled parents react to my scandalous Halloween outfits in which Sabri basically dresses up in a mature costume to get her parents opinion of course there's nothing wrong with showing off your body and no one's body should carry any sort of stigma however she isn't even 18 yet and a lot of people have questioned if it's a wise decision to make a video that could bait creeps into clicking for the wrong reasons purely for money this video literally got over a million views and I feel like considering the fact that the Norris nuts is known to be a channel focused around children it's pretty naive of Justin and Brooke to not think about who might be using videos like this for disturbing reasons because the Norris nuts are basically the reason the channel has so many subscribers and the reason that the channel makes so much money it has brought up a debate on whether the parents may actually be exploiting their children there is at least one video per week uploaded to their YouTube and these aren't just simple q a type videos that can be filmed quickly in an hour the content consists of Vlogs that require the children to be in front of the camera constantly for entertainment and also challenges that sometimes go on for a whole 24 hours and it looks like obviously the hard work of the Norris nuts has paid off as they easily make a million views per video which has led them to taking home an estimated 28 million dollars per year however neither Brooke or Justin have ever really shared whether the money is actually going or if the children are even paid at all we can see some of the areas that it goes to for example their huge house and lots of expensive vacations but for all we know as soon as the kids grow up and move out there is no evidence to suggest that any of them will be set up for Life by the money that they themselves earned by working their entire Our Lives even though to so many the questions about how ethical the Norris Channel and parenting is seems pretty apparent and clear Justin and Brooke have mostly escaped any major backlash this is probably a result of their target audience being children and young teenagers who don't really understand how a lot of what the norrises are doing is wrong but this clean streak didn't last forever as there was one occasion in particular where the norrises landed themselves in a lot of trouble so by this point we can see that Justin and Brooke have used their children to make millions of dollars but it turns out that it didn't just stop with their kids as they actually have a pretty disturbing history with exploiting animals that they purchase to be new pets and the way that one of these pets was treated caused a lot of people to see Justin and Brooke for who they really were the norrises bought their dog called Bubba from a puppy Farm despite Justin being known for not being the biggest fan of dogs and Biggie being scared of them the first red flag of this situation was that they bought Bubba from a puppy Farm which are extremely unethical Brooke attempted to justify spending thousands of dollars on the new family pet because according to her rescue dogs have problems with their skin however puppy Farms like the one that Bubba was purchased are at are literally illegal in the state of Victoria in Australia then not long after Bubba was introduced the YouTubers announced that their new puppy had sadly passed away due to some sort of accident involving Justin but they were extremely vague in their video update and didn't really give any details on what happened allegedly the parents role on their Instagram that Justin had accidentally stepped on the dog which caused its death however this was then swiftly deleted and no one was 100 sure of what happened however what made this situation a whole new level of problematic was that Bubba passed away just six days after Justin and Brooke brought it home however they kept this illusion going on that Bubba was still alive so that they could make money off the small amount of content that they got before announcing her death and to top things off the kids are known to edit the videos so essentially after basically being trauma ties by seeing their brand new puppy die they had to edit content made with the puppy knowing that Bubba was dead Brooke and Justin then pretty much immediately replaced Bubba with a brand new dog who was yet again bought from a puppy Farm who they called winky thankfully winky didn't meet the same fate as Bubba but the damage had already been done and tons of people were completely outraged with how irresponsible Justin and Brooke were one user on Reddit wrote they didn't do their research when deciding to take these pets and it's obvious they want the pets because they're cute and fluffy the Norse nuts channel has definitely brought up a long debate on social media which is where the line crosses between sharing your children online to exploiting them for money of course no one really knows the full truth on whether there is something dark going on behind the scenes or if Justin and Brooke are actually like any other parents but perhaps a little naive what do you guys think thanks for watching and I'll see you all next time
