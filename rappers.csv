03/07/2023,Kanye FUMES Over Daughterâ€™s TikToks..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEO-QSy_fto,112-20,I am her father I know y'all don't respect fathers and the idea of family and media tries to promote something I said I am not allowing my daughter to be used by Tick Tock most men do not there's no such thing as 50 50 custody in society today I spice in Northwest lighted or it was over on the Kim and North Tick Tock page and a lot of people have some mixed opinions about this Duo people are very upset with Northwest for becoming ice spice so a few days ago Kim Kardashian let ice spice come over and film videos with their daughter North now nothing was really wrong with the videos that her and I spice filmed together but now people are seeing it as a problem because North is cosplaying as ice spice she's posted several videos where she's dressed exactly like I spice and she acts like I spice and people are not happy with these videos basically they're saying things like Kanye was right or that North has gone way too far with this and a lot of people are upset with Kim saying that this behavior is not harmless some people are here for it and others are not remember I just wanna play but more importantly Kanye West is being brought into the picture after Northwest was seen posting this Tick Tock that got a lot of controversy this Tick Tock ended up being deleted and it's no longer on North's Tick Tock page baby but there's people that are reposting it everywhere and a lot of people are not so happy with what's going on in this Tick Tock as well as going as for a Sebastian Kim for her parenting style this past week Kanye West's past concerns with Tick Tock as well as him not being able to see his daughter have been resurfacing after his daughter Northwest imitated ice Spice in a tick tock video hey everybody I just got off the phone with Kim I told her to stop antagonizing me with this Tick Tock thing I said it's never again I am her father I know y'all don't respect fathers and the idea of family and media tries to promote something I said I am not allowing my daughter to be used by Tick Tock to be used by Disney uh I have a say-so and then when people say are they going to use this for you in court I don't even I didn't have a say-some whether nothing with the Sierra Canyon most men do not there's no such thing as 50 50 custody with with in society today that's not that's not even it always leans towards the mom but right now and I'm happy that you guys got to see just a small piece of what I dealt with you understand God I just need to protect my CH you protect the children you touch them please God today the devil ain't gonna win you know I'm saying this is gaslighting no you guys may be wondering how Northwest and someone like ice spice would be collabing together there's clearly a huge age difference and yeah well this all started last month when North shared a portrait that she Drew of ice spice on Tech talk I spice has since returned the favor by dancing in a series of videos with North this past week and people were pretty shocked that they actually ended up meeting together and that I spice was able to show up and show some love to North as she was a big fan of her now though northwest's newest series of tick tock posts is really stirring up some conversation uis in a series of posts shared on March 6th literally yesterday North decided to post a tick tock where she's cosplaying I spice she was literally all out wearing the curly orange wig and an eye spice-like outfit while she danced freely to one of her songs and mowed it along to ice spices lyrics which was also another controversial topic people are pointing out how the lyrics seem very explicit especially for someone one like North who's only nine years old to be lip syncing or even mouthing and saying that she shouldn't even have access to this type of music with North just being nine years old that led a lot of people on social media to criticize her after seeing this Tick Tock video of her go viral all of her social media people are saying that she shouldn't be able to meet someone like I spice and there's just a lot being said about this you guys this is exactly why Kanye didn't want his nine-year-old daughter North on social media because you have weirdos like this Kim is a terrible parent a broke clock is right twice a day Kanye was right about not wanting his daughter on Tech talk now she's dressing like I spice and reciting lyrics like that he just a reminder Northwest is nine years old the Kardashians have sons as well yet I never see them plastered all over social media it's almost as if they are explored Northwest for their own gains and trying to mold their daughters into the next generation of Kardashians I might have to side with the outrage on the debate of North Kanye and Isis eight or nine-year-olds making Tech talks to these lyrics someone somewhere should have stopped this discussions continue over on Reddit with a lot of people saying things like I legit feel bad for yay these are the real life fears that have been eating away at him and driving him nuts lately I guarantee it imagine the world waiting with Glee to see your little girl it's horrible fourth grader by the way dang I thought she was a middle schooler already SMH at least North seems to know which parts are not age appropriate so kudos to her but this ain't it yay's punching the air right now Kanye was right once again this is why Kanye didn't want his daughter to have Tick-Tock did she just quote I spice [Music] Kanye's gonna lose his another person said Kanye was right and y'all are just ignorant no way you see an actual child dressing up like this rapper who makes music about cute and funny it's disgusting everyone who called Kanye West crazy owes the brother an apology nord's grandmother has her own daughters out to create a brand so her doing so with grandchildren is no shock some people resurfaced an older video of Kanye that's been going around all over social media where he talks about Tick Tock as well as Northwest his daughter and not being able to see her it was funny I felt like people just they just want to see they want to see somebody melt down they want to see a dad a father a human being they want to see what's going to happen right now if I could be gas lit if I could be pushed to a limit we see now factually that I was asking demanding to see my children and bring them to Sunday service with me because that's you know one of the places they get to be why do I have to even give an explanation but the fact that I was praying online in a public format to suit my children unless you know how out diminish I have been as a father that I could even get to that point because as I was leaving church and my kids wasn't there I was like why should I have to pray to see my children anyways guys this has been what's been going on with Kanye West Kim Kardashian and north and what a lot of people are having to say about her recent Tech talks with ice spice and how North is imitating her I definitely want to know what you guys think about this situation in the comments down below I love you guys so much and as always I'll see y'all thank you [Music]

08/12/2022,The Sad Truth About Doja Cat Shaving Her Hair Off..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiWo5mAi8uE,18-16,um 1 re some people out there accusing doja cat of consuming pills just because she shaved her entire head off damn y'all must crave drama so bad aside from doja cat getting dragged this week for shaving her head off unfortunately kim kardashian and pete davidson also announced their breakup which led to kanye west getting involved and y'all even the euphoria actor jacob elordie received tons of hate after he revealed disturbing information about him that shouldn't have been shared on the internet there's a lot to address in today's video so without further ado let's start with doja cat to be honest i feel like none of y'all are actually willing to give doja cat a break and before anyone comes after me i do want to make it clear that i totally understand the hate she received in the past about the noah schnapp situation and i'm aware of the reason why tons of people came after her and called her out for victimizing noah on live but i do want to go back two years before the noah situation went down because as the majority of you guys know doja has been a well-known troll on social media before she became popular i mean we've all seen her do some funny and crazy stuff during her instagram lives which low-key made her get recognized for having a quirky and bubbly personality on social media however as most of her fan base enjoyed this side of doja some people actually hated it and what i mean by this is so many people started...
07/18/2022,Doja Cat CALLED OUT For Bullying A 17 YEAR OLD..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-RgRWuPPg8,33-20,excuse me but how do people go from praising doja cat straight up canceling her twice within a week no something isn't adding up this time before we address the huge drama dosiacat got involved in which included noah schnapp and amber heard we're gonna dive deep into dojicat's life first and how she managed to become a huge star after she had the biggest celebrity cancellation back in 2020 so without further ado you guys let's jump right in you know doja cat is probably one of the most interesting people that i've seen in the hollywood industry and i don't mean this in a shady way i just wonder how she managed to gain the level of success she has at the moment from a meme video that she posted back in 2018. yeah in case you didn't know doja has been doing music ever since she was 18 years old and she was raised by her mother throughout her childhood as her dad was absent most of the time even though there isn't much background on doja's childhood and the environment she lived in she pretty much found herself making and releasing music which made her gain a bit of attention from some of her followers now i do want to make it clear that doja is one of the celebrities who never seeked fame or attention from anyone since she was just minding her own business creating music for her small fan base while trolling online as usual everything changed when she had a career breakthrough back in 2018. after she went on instagram live and decided to write produce and...
