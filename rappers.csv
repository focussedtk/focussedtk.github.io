of allisn't it a bit suspicious that hedisappeared for some time only to showup as a whole different person frombooks fashion sense and even physique uhKanye clone you ain't fooling nobodyanyways without further Ado let's justjump right to where it all started sofor those of you who don't know Kanye'sfans started noticing that he had beenM.I.A in late 2022 after his majoroutbursts that got him cancellationsleft right and Center a yeah that was adark time for yay fast forward tomid-January 2023 Kanye made a ratherunusual reappearance something wasdifferent about him but his looks asidethere was one more person of interestBianca sensori we would later learn fromTMZ that this was Kanye's new wife likeno one knew this woman she literallycame out of the blue as Kanye's wifewhen he came back from wherever hedisappeared to only to show up besidesyay from wherever he had gone to andthere's a conspiracy she's his Handlerjust take a look at this photo thatemerged in April yeah something was offI totally understand why some peoplefeel that Kanye isn't even Kanye anymoreyou don't have to look too far to noticehow different he is from the yay we knownow he looked spaced out robotic andliterally emotionless just take a lookat what some fans had to say colonierbro been playing God of War or somethingthat ain't yay they cloned him to makematters worse rumors started spreadingaround the same time that this newperson was not Kanye which is why peopleare now convinced that the person we'reseeing is either Kanye's clone or animposter but I don't know about you guysKanye is at a very weird point in hislife and he's definitely going through alot that's not all there's also otherissues which are being discussed a lothis mental health especially after hiscontroversial statements in the pastwhile some people saw physical changesin his cloned version others couldn'thelp but notice how unhappy he lookedhere's what other fans had to say bloodlooks like his mama forced him to take apicture why is he dressed like he's in aretirement home straight out of therapytype fit to understand where thesecloning speculations have come from wemust address the elephant in the roombecause Kanye West wasn't always actinglike this there are allegations ofcontrol and manipulation in theentertainment industry and some believeKanye is a target of such major thingswhen Elon Musk took over Twitter heimmediately reinstated Kanye's accountand whoa did y'all see the bizarremessages from his personal trainerHarley pasternackso it's one of a couple ways first youand I sit down and have a loving andopen conversation but you don't use cusswordsand everything that is discussed isbased in fact and that's some crazystuff that dumb friend of yours told youor you saw the tree second optionI have you institutionalized againwhere they medicate the crap out of youand you go back to Zombieland foreverplay dateplay date with the kids just won't bethe same this message did not sit rightwith me and it got me thinking is Harleyjust a personal trainer or a celebrityHandler so let's talk about this Harleyguy and this cloning thing will makesense I promise there's no way a typicaltrainer would talk to a client like thatwhat does he know that we don't rememberthis is a guy who has worked with quitea number of celebrities who have hadmeltdowns publicly or mysteriously diedof overdosing people like Amy Winehouseand Mac Miller but what's even crazieris that he previously worked in themilitary conducting research onexperimental drugs so working for themilitary I wasn't governed by the samelaws that the typical person was so Icould look at the impact of certaindrugs that are not that or not every dayokay now get this do you remember in2016 when Kanye was checked into apsychiatric hospital After experiencinga meltdown publicly guess who was withhim and even called 9-1-1 Harleypasternack the same guy that's nowsending him such a disturbing text itwas after this incident that Kanye wasdiagnosed with bipolar disorder and puton medicationuh you didn't hear it from me but he wasactually put in zombie mode I clearlyremember how Kanye was a shell ofhimself when he was discharged KanyeWest would be supposedly diagnosed withbipolar disorder and turned into a quotezombie with these haunting photos beingreleased showing a shallow exhaustedlooking game since then heultimate Chatterboxcontroversy honestly guys as much as I'mnot entirely convinced about humancloning I'm not a scientist I kind ofsort of see how Kanye got here theindustry is evil enough to mess withsomeone's brain in case you've forgottenall these things happened around thesame time that Kanye West was working onhis album titled turbo graph x16. take alook at the song titled UCLA where hedocumented what used to happen while hewas admitted to the facility you're madJay take your medjay take your med Jaytake your meds Jay you need some Nikeafter that Kanye has never been the sameagain his erratic behaviors haveactually progressed over time from theoutside looking in we've heard all sortsof stories about how crazy and Shady theindustry is and worse still how theycontrol and eliminate people likeWhitney Houston Kanye has been boldenough to talk about how they wanted tofinish him the same way they did toBritney Spears this leaves me wonderingare they trying to get rid of Kanye Westso you see as outrageous as thesecloning stories are what if someone istrying to get rid of Kanye West what ifthey've done it already and what if theydid something terrible to him such thatpeople can't take him seriously anymoreand rubbish everything he says as Talesof a Madman well Orlando Brown was amongthe people who openly talked about thisboldly saying that there are two Kanye'sthe shorter Kanye and the taller Kanyeif you guys actually realize like likehow there's a taller Kanye and a smallerKanye they're fighting for who's goingto be Kanyethey're fighting for who's gonna beKanye dude right in front of you okay sonow let's shift gears to anotherscandalous part of yay and oh boy can wetalk about his outfits granted his senseof fashion has always been questionablebut this new Kanye is on another levelof absurdity he is literally MakingWaves in the tabloids and Kanye has beenseen wearing some very unusual outfits Imean who is this he was spotted in hisstore with a bushy beard contrary to hissignature clean shave Kanye's recentphotos look nothing like him everyrecent photo or publication about himshows him looking unrecognizable andbehaving funny he wore a gray shirt withred stripes across the chest and anemblem on the side he paired the topwith a tight pair of legging style pantsand green rubber boots that reachedalmost to his knee and if you think thisoutfit was ridiculous here's a strangerone where he went shoeless he wasspotted on a date casually walkingaround in blue socks gross the star wasalso seen wearing shoulder pads underhis shirt photos of the singer wereposted on Kardashian internet Forum towhich many called his look ridiculoushere's what some fans had to say itfeels like he views his entire purposein life as some performative circle jerkit has to be exhausting and is certainlynot good for his already unstable mentalhe looks like a kid who was cut from theteam but refuses to take the practicegear off I think he finds pleasure inthinking he can make any ridiculousoutfit a fashion trend for the maskKanye has a habit of Disappearing andreappearing out of the blue which kindof makes it hard to know if somethingsinister happened during his recentdisappearance or if he's just cloutchasing Kanye double AI robot or clonehowever your theories are has clearlylost Direction when walking into thewall the body language tells us all thisis something elseno that's not him allegedly they can'tdiscuss that it would sabotage theirplatforms okay so we're dying to knowwho is Kanye's new wifeapparently their Affair started as anoffice romance now that Bianca has beenworking at Yeezy since 2020 as head ofarchitecture other than Bianca'ssuspicious entrance into yay's lifepeople also paid attention to his songsensory overload and the lyrics stoodout but guys there's another version tothis some people are saying that Kanyeis the one controlling her I mean isn'tshe literally taking this for better orworse thing too seriously it's one thingfor Kanye to be this controversial Imean it is Kanye West hello however whatthis version of Kanye is putting hiswife through is an entirely new circuslook at her being dragged across thestreet like a pet[Music]and let's not forget that Kanye has beenknown to make his Partners dress up in away that pleases him do you guysremember when he did an entire overhaulof Kim's wardrobe at the time it lookedlike a thoughtful Act of love but nowthat things have come full circle we canconclude that he wanted Kim to dress ina particular way here she accompaniedKanye to church and people have had afield day mocking her not to be rude butI know she got to be sick that Kim K gotall the good clothes and she's walkingaround in a broken black condom thisgotta be Photoshop ain't no way man on alighter note some people said that Kanyeis making her cover her face because shelooks like Pete Davidson KimKardashian's ex-boyfriend what ahilarious Twist of events either waytheir Union has started off amid toomuch controversy is she a wife or aHandler also is it just me or did y'allsee something fishy when Kanye tookBianca shopping at Balenciaga in as muchas Kanye thrives on controversy he hasbeen very local and calling outBalenciaga as well as celebrities thatstill collaborate with Balenciaga andwould you believe me when I tell youthat he turned around and took his wifeshopping at Balenciaga some fans wereconvinced that there was no way the realKanye would step foot in Balenciaga andhere is what they had to say there's noway my dude would have married thatquick and went shopping at Balenciagaeither yeah I'm thinking somethinghappened to Kanye how do you go fromexposing Balenciaga to shopping therenow Kanye can be a lot of things but anabsent father isn't one of them butsince he resurfaced recently how come wehaven't seen him anywhere near his kidssince he's been back you don't see onepic of him with his children and Kanyeadores his kids that's not him weliterally remember his divorce with Kimas one of the ugliest Hollywood has everwitnessed especially because even theirkids weren't spared Kanye was trying tosay that Kim doesn't spend enough timewith the kids and left her parentingrole to the nannies and we stillremember him calling him out for puttingtheir daughter North on Tick Tockagainst His Wish isn't it weird

04/02/2023,Lil Kim Reveals How 50 Cent Tried To K!ll Her Career,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0pdsxDWR0E,138-16,it looks like the 50 Cent and Lil Kim Feud is nowhere close to being over after all these years but did Lil Kim really blame 50 Cent for trying to sabotage her career and y'all are not going to believe the crazy stunt 50 Cent pool to try to ruin Lil Kim's reputation honestly I don't even think that we should be surprised at this point because we all know that 50 Cent is the king of pettiness and he has had so many feuds that it's difficult to point out any rapper that 50 hasn't beefed with at one time or another now his beef with Lil Kim has been getting crazier and Crazier by the year and a lot of people don't even know what happened or how it started it's like we just woke up one day and they started attacking each other online and when I say attacking I mean it literally cause child these two ain't got no chill when it comes to dragging each other through the streets of the internet the first time Lil Kim addressed their beef was in 2005 when she told Associated Press I can't front I don't have a lot of respect for 50 Cent because his music is Hardcore violent and I love love his music sometimes but I feel like in his personal life his real life he carries that on and that's not a great message you know what I mean I think he promotes it how can a man have beef with a woman whatever that's just not cool she basically told him to mind the business that pays him and keep her name out of his mouth and knowing 50 Cent he just had to reply and he dissed her in multiple songs even calling her out for her plastic surgery in his song piggy bank he said freak B looked like Kim before the surgery and in his song Love Me he wrapped I thought Lil Kim was hot till she stopped messing with her nose that's not all because in 2021 he made fun of Kim by comparing her to a leprechaun and of course she called him out for being obsessed with her saying you're so obsessed with me is getting creepy this one ain't it bro not funny at all I was hoping to laugh with you but corny boo you falling off I'm too bad and too fly in this video you reaching now but we all know why can we say obsessed with Kimmy much LMAO keep them coming Booboo only lets me know I'm on your brain 24 7. I love it then there's the time he compared her to an owl saying who did this this ain't right lol catch for life on IMDb TV now again Kim hopped in his comments saying stuff like this don't move me one way or another cause I'm still a bad B that men's women's mommies daughters and aunties still want to be till this day and I love it I see you still in your Fields about that dinner date you asked me on that I had to turn down let it go you have a beautiful girlfriend I have a loving husband let it go now this is where we started to get an idea of what actually led to their beef because Kim hinted that 50 had made a move on her but she turned him down and that's why he's been so salty I mean no shade to 50 or anything like that but I think we can all agree that this is the type of thing that he do he's been known to hold grudges for a very long time and do petty things just despite the other person I mean this is the same guy that bought 200 front row tickets to Gyro's concert just to make sure that the seats were empty and make it look like the concert was a failure I mean do y'all know how awkward it would have been for Ja Rule to perform in front of empty seats yeah 50 is petty AF so I can definitely see him still being salty over Kim turning him down then in 2022 things got to a nasty point when 50 tried to incite beef between Nikki and Lil Kim Lil Kim dropped the song with Megan the stallion titled Plan B where she said man user B your father's a b your brother's a b keep acting like this and your son gonna be a b people kind of assumed that she was dissing Nikki in a song you know because of the whole essay thingy about Nikki's husband and her brother plus Nikki and Kim used to have bad blood so people felt like this was a diss well 50 took his chance and tried to start more trouble saying Nicki Minaj you better light her up I'm watching she said something about the baby but her baby eyes messed up I'm not gonna lie it's kind of weird how he brought up Kim's child for no reason especially since he wasn't involved in the drama in the first place talk about a weirdo Lil Kim commented it's okay he's just doing what B men do now watch what God do to his life she also released a statement saying I never said a word about anyone's child please feel free to listen to the song where we were clearly talking about an X to try and twist my words to have an excuse to take digs that my child is disgusting I'm one of the most disrespected Legends in the game but what you will not do is come for my child she also put 50 on blast saying it's so crazy how a song about Beeman could touch a b-man's soul so deeply that he results to attacking a child okay 50 you got me the song was about you she continued I still can't believe y'all can't see through 50s lame disgraceful ugly and narcissistic tactics y'all still falling for that ish he created this whole false narrative to cause drama and confusion because the girl he wanted is getting too much attention this is the second time Kim is talking about how 50 is salty over being rejected and I think that's part of the issue here I mean he did say in his song that he thought she was hot so it makes sense that he would move to her plus he's always the one attacking her first which is certainly weird but it turns out that the rejection is not the entire story because 50 Cent actually tried to ruin Kim's career and that's why the beef is so bitter back in 2003 Lil Kim and 50 Cent collaborated on the song I got the magic stick which quickly became a hit and even peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. Kim was having a successful moment with the song and naturally wanted to film a video but for some reason 50 refused to appear in the video there's a song called Magic Stick 50 you know it was a little Kim song featuring 50 Cent the song became a big song and this was when 50 was on fire song was huge it was one of Kim's biggest songs in quite a while 50 didn't want to do the music video the song was Kim's big return to rap and it was important for her to push the song with a music video so she could fully revive her career but she couldn't exactly do a video without 50 because he had a big part in the song so the planned music video had to be scrapped and this kind of affected the performance of the album because Magic Stick was the most successful single on the album it's not hard to see why Kim would keep a grudge over that but it's kind of wild to see 50 keep attacking her over the years like she's the guilty party someone commented 50 Cent Petty butt been messing with Lil Kim ever since the magic stick Fiasco I can't even listen to the song in my throwback jams no more because he been out of pocket and disrespectful another person said 50 Cent has never been a good person look how he treated his own kid he made fun of little Kim's daughter's looks he talked ish about men all the darn time that man is not above being messy I want to know what y'all think about this messy drama do you think 50 Cent is ever going to stop being messy and get over his beef or do y'all think they both gonna take this drama to the grave and if you think this is messy you're definitely going to love the next video because it's way messier than this one 
03/07/2023,Kanye FUMES Over Daughter’s TikToks..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEO-QSy_fto,112-20,I am her father I know y'all don't respect fathers and the idea of family and media tries to promote something I said I am not allowing my daughter to be used by Tick Tock most men do not there's no such thing as 50 50 custody in society today I spice in Northwest lighted or it was over on the Kim and North Tick Tock page and a lot of people have some mixed opinions about this Duo people are very upset with Northwest for becoming ice spice so a few days ago Kim Kardashian let ice spice come over and film videos with their daughter North now nothing was really wrong with the videos that her and I spice filmed together but now people are seeing it as a problem because North is cosplaying as ice spice she's posted several videos where she's dressed exactly like I spice and she acts like I spice and people are not happy with these videos basically they're saying things like Kanye was right or that North has gone way too far with this and a lot of people are upset with Kim saying that this behavior is not harmless some people are here for it and others are not remember I just wanna play but more importantly Kanye West is being brought into the picture after Northwest was seen posting this Tick Tock that got a lot of controversy this Tick Tock ended up being deleted and it's no longer on North's Tick Tock page baby but there's people that are reposting it everywhere and a lot of people are not so happy with what's going on in this Tick Tock as well as going as for a Sebastian Kim for her parenting style this past week Kanye West's past concerns with Tick Tock as well as him not being able to see his daughter have been resurfacing after his daughter Northwest imitated ice Spice in a tick tock video hey everybody I just got off the phone with Kim I told her to stop antagonizing me with this Tick Tock thing I said it's never again I am her father I know y'all don't respect fathers and the idea of family and media tries to promote something I said I am not allowing my daughter to be used by Tick Tock to be used by Disney uh I have a say-so and then when people say are they going to use this for you in court I don't even I didn't have a say-some whether nothing with the Sierra Canyon most men do not there's no such thing as 50 50 custody with with in society today that's not that's not even it always leans towards the mom but right now and I'm happy that you guys got to see just a small piece of what I dealt with you understand God I just need to protect my CH you protect the children you touch them please God today the devil ain't gonna win you know I'm saying this is gaslighting no you guys may be wondering how Northwest and someone like ice spice would be collabing together there's clearly a huge age difference and yeah well this all started last month when North shared a portrait that she Drew of ice spice on Tech talk I spice has since returned the favor by dancing in a series of videos with North this past week and people were pretty shocked that they actually ended up meeting together and that I spice was able to show up and show some love to North as she was a big fan of her now though northwest's newest series of tick tock posts is really stirring up some conversation uis in a series of posts shared on March 6th literally yesterday North decided to post a tick tock where she's cosplaying I spice she was literally all out wearing the curly orange wig and an eye spice-like outfit while she danced freely to one of her songs and mowed it along to ice spices lyrics which was also another controversial topic people are pointing out how the lyrics seem very explicit especially for someone one like North who's only nine years old to be lip syncing or even mouthing and saying that she shouldn't even have access to this type of music with North just being nine years old that led a lot of people on social media to criticize her after seeing this Tick Tock video of her go viral all of her social media people are saying that she shouldn't be able to meet someone like I spice and there's just a lot being said about this you guys this is exactly why Kanye didn't want his nine-year-old daughter North on social media because you have weirdos like this Kim is a terrible parent a broke clock is right twice a day Kanye was right about not wanting his daughter on Tech talk now she's dressing like I spice and reciting lyrics like that he just a reminder Northwest is nine years old the Kardashians have sons as well yet I never see them plastered all over social media it's almost as if they are explored Northwest for their own gains and trying to mold their daughters into the next generation of Kardashians I might have to side with the outrage on the debate of North Kanye and Isis eight or nine-year-olds making Tech talks to these lyrics someone somewhere should have stopped this discussions continue over on Reddit with a lot of people saying things like I legit feel bad for yay these are the real life fears that have been eating away at him and driving him nuts lately I guarantee it imagine the world waiting with Glee to see your little girl it's horrible fourth grader by the way dang I thought she was a middle schooler already SMH at least North seems to know which parts are not age appropriate so kudos to her but this ain't it yay's punching the air right now Kanye was right once again this is why Kanye didn't want his daughter to have Tick-Tock did she just quote I spice [Music] Kanye's gonna lose his another person said Kanye was right and y'all are just ignorant no way you see an actual child dressing up like this rapper who makes music about cute and funny it's disgusting everyone who called Kanye West crazy owes the brother an apology nord's grandmother has her own daughters out to create a brand so her doing so with grandchildren is no shock some people resurfaced an older video of Kanye that's been going around all over social media where he talks about Tick Tock as well as Northwest his daughter and not being able to see her it was funny I felt like people just they just want to see they want to see somebody melt down they want to see a dad a father a human being they want to see what's going to happen right now if I could be gas lit if I could be pushed to a limit we see now factually that I was asking demanding to see my children and bring them to Sunday service with me because that's you know one of the places they get to be why do I have to even give an explanation but the fact that I was praying online in a public format to suit my children unless you know how out diminish I have been as a father that I could even get to that point because as I was leaving church and my kids wasn't there I was like why should I have to pray to see my children anyways guys this has been what's been going on with Kanye West Kim Kardashian and north and what a lot of people are having to say about her recent Tech talks with ice spice and how North is imitating her I definitely want to know what you guys think about this situation in the comments down below I love you guys so much and as always I'll see y'all thank you [Music]
