04/02/2023,Lil Kim Reveals How 50 Cent Tried To K!ll Her Career,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0pdsxDWR0E,138-16,it looks like the 50 Cent and Lil Kim Feud is nowhere close to being over after all these years but did Lil Kim really blame 50 Cent for trying to sabotage her career and y'all are not going to believe the crazy stunt 50 Cent pool to try to ruin Lil Kim's reputation honestly I don't even think that we should be surprised at this point because we all know that 50 Cent is the king of pettiness and he has had so many feuds that it's difficult to point out any rapper that 50 hasn't beefed with at one time or another now his beef with Lil Kim has been getting crazier and Crazier by the year and a lot of people don't even know what happened or how it started it's like we just woke up one day and they started attacking each other online and when I say attacking I mean it literally cause child these two ain't got no chill when it comes to dragging each other through the streets of the internet the first time Lil Kim addressed their beef was in 2005 when she told Associated Press I can't front I don't have a lot of respect for 50 Cent because his music is Hardcore violent and I love love his music sometimes but I feel like in his personal life his real life he carries that on and that's not a great message you know what I mean I think he promotes it how can a man have beef with a woman whatever that's just not cool she basically told him to mind the business that pays him and keep her name out of his mouth and knowing 50 Cent he just had to reply and he dissed her in multiple songs even calling her out for her plastic surgery in his song piggy bank he said freak B looked like Kim before the surgery and in his song Love Me he wrapped I thought Lil Kim was hot till she stopped messing with her nose that's not all because in 2021 he made fun of Kim by comparing her to a leprechaun and of course she called him out for being obsessed with her saying you're so obsessed with me is getting creepy this one ain't it bro not funny at all I was hoping to laugh with you but corny boo you falling off I'm too bad and too fly in this video you reaching now but we all know why can we say obsessed with Kimmy much LMAO keep them coming Booboo only lets me know I'm on your brain 24 7. I love it then there's the time he compared her to an owl saying who did this this ain't right lol catch for life on IMDb TV now again Kim hopped in his comments saying stuff like this don't move me one way or another cause I'm still a bad B that men's women's mommies daughters and aunties still want to be till this day and I love it I see you still in your Fields about that dinner date you asked me on that I had to turn down let it go you have a beautiful girlfriend I have a loving husband let it go now this is where we started to get an idea of what actually led to their beef because Kim hinted that 50 had made a move on her but she turned him down and that's why he's been so salty I mean no shade to 50 or anything like that but I think we can all agree that this is the type of thing that he do he's been known to hold grudges for a very long time and do petty things just despite the other person I mean this is the same guy that bought 200 front row tickets to Gyro's concert just to make sure that the seats were empty and make it look like the concert was a failure I mean do y'all know how awkward it would have been for Ja Rule to perform in front of empty seats yeah 50 is petty AF so I can definitely see him still being salty over Kim turning him down then in 2022 things got to a nasty point when 50 tried to incite beef between Nikki and Lil Kim Lil Kim dropped the song with Megan the stallion titled Plan B where she said man user B your father's a b your brother's a b keep acting like this and your son gonna be a b people kind of assumed that she was dissing Nikki in a song you know because of the whole essay thingy about Nikki's husband and her brother plus Nikki and Kim used to have bad blood so people felt like this was a diss well 50 took his chance and tried to start more trouble saying Nicki Minaj you better light her up I'm watching she said something about the baby but her baby eyes messed up I'm not gonna lie it's kind of weird how he brought up Kim's child for no reason especially since he wasn't involved in the drama in the first place talk about a weirdo Lil Kim commented it's okay he's just doing what B men do now watch what God do to his life she also released a statement saying I never said a word about anyone's child please feel free to listen to the song where we were clearly talking about an X to try and twist my words to have an excuse to take digs that my child is disgusting I'm one of the most disrespected Legends in the game but what you will not do is come for my child she also put 50 on blast saying it's so crazy how a song about Beeman could touch a b-man's soul so deeply that he results to attacking a child okay 50 you got me the song was about you she continued I still can't believe y'all can't see through 50s lame disgraceful ugly and narcissistic tactics y'all still falling for that ish he created this whole false narrative to cause drama and confusion because the girl he wanted is getting too much attention this is the second time Kim is talking about how 50 is salty over being rejected and I think that's part of the issue here I mean he did say in his song that he thought she was hot so it makes sense that he would move to her plus he's always the one attacking her first which is certainly weird but it turns out that the rejection is not the entire story because 50 Cent actually tried to ruin Kim's career and that's why the beef is so bitter back in 2003 Lil Kim and 50 Cent collaborated on the song I got the magic stick which quickly became a hit and even peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. Kim was having a successful moment with the song and naturally wanted to film a video but for some reason 50 refused to appear in the video there's a song called Magic Stick 50 you know it was a little Kim song featuring 50 Cent the song became a big song and this was when 50 was on fire song was huge it was one of Kim's biggest songs in quite a while 50 didn't want to do the music video the song was Kim's big return to rap and it was important for her to push the song with a music video so she could fully revive her career but she couldn't exactly do a video without 50 because he had a big part in the song so the planned music video had to be scrapped and this kind of affected the performance of the album because Magic Stick was the most successful single on the album it's not hard to see why Kim would keep a grudge over that but it's kind of wild to see 50 keep attacking her over the years like she's the guilty party someone commented 50 Cent Petty butt been messing with Lil Kim ever since the magic stick Fiasco I can't even listen to the song in my throwback jams no more because he been out of pocket and disrespectful another person said 50 Cent has never been a good person look how he treated his own kid he made fun of little Kim's daughter's looks he talked ish about men all the darn time that man is not above being messy I want to know what y'all think about this messy drama do you think 50 Cent is ever going to stop being messy and get over his beef or do y'all think they both gonna take this drama to the grave and if you think this is messy you're definitely going to love the next video because it's way messier than this one 
03/07/2023,Kanye FUMES Over Daughterâ€™s TikToks..,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEO-QSy_fto,112-20,I am her father I know y'all don't respect fathers and the idea of family and media tries to promote something I said I am not allowing my daughter to be used by Tick Tock most men do not there's no such thing as 50 50 custody in society today I spice in Northwest lighted or it was over on the Kim and North Tick Tock page and a lot of people have some mixed opinions about this Duo people are very upset with Northwest for becoming ice spice so a few days ago Kim Kardashian let ice spice come over and film videos with their daughter North now nothing was really wrong with the videos that her and I spice filmed together but now people are seeing it as a problem because North is cosplaying as ice spice she's posted several videos where she's dressed exactly like I spice and she acts like I spice and people are not happy with these videos basically they're saying things like Kanye was right or that North has gone way too far with this and a lot of people are upset with Kim saying that this behavior is not harmless some people are here for it and others are not remember I just wanna play but more importantly Kanye West is being brought into the picture after Northwest was seen posting this Tick Tock that got a lot of controversy this Tick Tock ended up being deleted and it's no longer on North's Tick Tock page baby but there's people that are reposting it everywhere and a lot of people are not so happy with what's going on in this Tick Tock as well as going as for a Sebastian Kim for her parenting style this past week Kanye West's past concerns with Tick Tock as well as him not being able to see his daughter have been resurfacing after his daughter Northwest imitated ice Spice in a tick tock video hey everybody I just got off the phone with Kim I told her to stop antagonizing me with this Tick Tock thing I said it's never again I am her father I know y'all don't respect fathers and the idea of family and media tries to promote something I said I am not allowing my daughter to be used by Tick Tock to be used by Disney uh I have a say-so and then when people say are they going to use this for you in court I don't even I didn't have a say-some whether nothing with the Sierra Canyon most men do not there's no such thing as 50 50 custody with with in society today that's not that's not even it always leans towards the mom but right now and I'm happy that you guys got to see just a small piece of what I dealt with you understand God I just need to protect my CH you protect the children you touch them please God today the devil ain't gonna win you know I'm saying this is gaslighting no you guys may be wondering how Northwest and someone like ice spice would be collabing together there's clearly a huge age difference and yeah well this all started last month when North shared a portrait that she Drew of ice spice on Tech talk I spice has since returned the favor by dancing in a series of videos with North this past week and people were pretty shocked that they actually ended up meeting together and that I spice was able to show up and show some love to North as she was a big fan of her now though northwest's newest series of tick tock posts is really stirring up some conversation uis in a series of posts shared on March 6th literally yesterday North decided to post a tick tock where she's cosplaying I spice she was literally all out wearing the curly orange wig and an eye spice-like outfit while she danced freely to one of her songs and mowed it along to ice spices lyrics which was also another controversial topic people are pointing out how the lyrics seem very explicit especially for someone one like North who's only nine years old to be lip syncing or even mouthing and saying that she shouldn't even have access to this type of music with North just being nine years old that led a lot of people on social media to criticize her after seeing this Tick Tock video of her go viral all of her social media people are saying that she shouldn't be able to meet someone like I spice and there's just a lot being said about this you guys this is exactly why Kanye didn't want his nine-year-old daughter North on social media because you have weirdos like this Kim is a terrible parent a broke clock is right twice a day Kanye was right about not wanting his daughter on Tech talk now she's dressing like I spice and reciting lyrics like that he just a reminder Northwest is nine years old the Kardashians have sons as well yet I never see them plastered all over social media it's almost as if they are explored Northwest for their own gains and trying to mold their daughters into the next generation of Kardashians I might have to side with the outrage on the debate of North Kanye and Isis eight or nine-year-olds making Tech talks to these lyrics someone somewhere should have stopped this discussions continue over on Reddit with a lot of people saying things like I legit feel bad for yay these are the real life fears that have been eating away at him and driving him nuts lately I guarantee it imagine the world waiting with Glee to see your little girl it's horrible fourth grader by the way dang I thought she was a middle schooler already SMH at least North seems to know which parts are not age appropriate so kudos to her but this ain't it yay's punching the air right now Kanye was right once again this is why Kanye didn't want his daughter to have Tick-Tock did she just quote I spice [Music] Kanye's gonna lose his another person said Kanye was right and y'all are just ignorant no way you see an actual child dressing up like this rapper who makes music about cute and funny it's disgusting everyone who called Kanye West crazy owes the brother an apology nord's grandmother has her own daughters out to create a brand so her doing so with grandchildren is no shock some people resurfaced an older video of Kanye that's been going around all over social media where he talks about Tick Tock as well as Northwest his daughter and not being able to see her it was funny I felt like people just they just want to see they want to see somebody melt down they want to see a dad a father a human being they want to see what's going to happen right now if I could be gas lit if I could be pushed to a limit we see now factually that I was asking demanding to see my children and bring them to Sunday service with me because that's you know one of the places they get to be why do I have to even give an explanation but the fact that I was praying online in a public format to suit my children unless you know how out diminish I have been as a father that I could even get to that point because as I was leaving church and my kids wasn't there I was like why should I have to pray to see my children anyways guys this has been what's been going on with Kanye West Kim Kardashian and north and what a lot of people are having to say about her recent Tech talks with ice spice and how North is imitating her I definitely want to know what you guys think about this situation in the comments down below I love you guys so much and as always I'll see y'all thank you [Music]
